How you can infer the underlying sentiment from reviews?  How you can extract information from images to find visually-similar products to recommend?  How you construct an application that does all of these things in real time, and provides a front-end user experience?  That’s what you will build in this course!\n\nUsing what you’ve learned about machine learning thus far, you will build a general product recommender system that does much more than just find similar products  You will combine images of products with product descriptions and their reviews to create a truly innovative intelligent application.\n\nYou’ve probably heard that Deep Learning is making news across the world as one of the most promising techniques in machine learning, especially for analyzing image data. With every industry dedicating resources to unlock the deep learning potential, to be competitive, you will want to use these models in tasks such as image tagging, object recognition, speech recognition, and text analysis.  In this capstone, you will build deep learning models using neural networks, explore what they are, what they do, and how.  To remove the barrier introduced by designing, training, and tuning networks, and to be able to achieve high performance with less labeled data, you will also build deep learning classifiers tailored to your specific task using pre-trained models, which we call deep features.  \n\nAs a core piece of this capstone project, you will implement a deep learning model for image-based product recommendation.  You will then combine this visual model with text descriptions of products and information from reviews to build an exciting, end-to-end intelligent application that provides a novel product discovery experience.  You will then deploy it as a service, which you can share with your friends and potential employers.  \n\nLearning Outcomes:  By the end of this capstone, you will be able to:\n   -Explore a dataset of products, reviews and images.\n   -Build a product recommender.\n   -Describe how a neural network model is represented and how it encodes non-linear features.\n   -Combine different types of layers and activation functions to obtain better performance.\n   -Use pretrained models, such as deep features, for new classification tasks. \n   -Describe how these models can be applied in computer vision, text analytics and speech recognition.  \n   -Use visual features to find the products your users want.\n   -Incorporate review sentiment into the recommendation.\n   -Build an end-to-end application.\n   -Deploy it as a service.  \n   -Implement these techniques in Python.","partnerIds":["15"],"name":"Machine Learning Capstone: An Intelligent Application with Deep Learning","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"machine-learning","domainId":"data-science"}],"slug":"ml-capstone","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/bd/79e8104d0011e592b8a9c1c44cb3fe/gears-818461_1280.jpg","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"courseType":"v2.capstone"},{"id":"v1-1250","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/a1/2bddf0352b11e485649b7db944a974/Employability-MOOC-logo.png","description":"Learn how to make effective decisions about your future career and how to take control of your professional development by honing your critical thinking and employability skills.\nSuitable for anyone undertaking some form of study, regardless of academic discipline, interests or employment background.\n","slug":"career","partnerIds":["26"],"specializations":[],"domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-essentials"},{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"}],"courseType":"v1.session","name":"Enhance Your Career and Employability Skills","primaryLanguages":["en"]},{"id":"v1-185","partnerIds":["33"],"specializations":[],"slug":"wealthofnations","courseType":"v1.session","description":"A survey of the history of economic development in the world in the past 300 years.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/ae/74409ddd8ac19b2deab9012d03041a/industrial-revolution-1.jpg","primaryLanguages":["en"],"domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"name":"Generating the Wealth of Nations"},{"id":"POZJ3uOtEeSoXCIACw4Gzg","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/00/a5a050b00f11e4a169f7e38b70cf48/20150130-1-03.png","name":"工程圖學 2D CAD","courseType":"v2.ondemand","primaryLanguages":["zh-TW"],"description":"工程圖學在教什麼？這門課有的重要性為何? 對我的專業有什麼幫助?沒有工程背景的人也可以學習工程圖學嗎？我不是工程師，學習工程圖學對我的生活有幫助嗎？\n這門課是CAD/BIM技術與應用專項課程的第一門課，與其他三門課「工程圖學2D專題」、「工程圖學3D」，及「工程圖學3D專題」，作為工程圖學及電腦繪圖的入門課程，你將在這門課會學到各種繪圖的原理與方法，以及AutoCAD電腦繪圖技術，並在相關的作業練習中，逐漸熟練這些基本技術。\n工程製圖的應用無所不在，最主要的目的就是利用圖像來描述物體的形貌與功能，作為保存與傳遞想法的工具。繪圖一點也不難，無論你從事什麼工作，來自什麼背景，只要你具備中學程度的基本幾何和三角函數概念，就可以在這裡從頭開始，學會工程圖學！你會驚訝的發現，當繪圖融入你的生活時帶來的趣味與方便！","partnerIds":["75"],"specializations":[],"slug":"2d-cad","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"mechanical-engineering","domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering"}]},{"id":"ugSnwH9hEeSiIiIAC3lQMQ","description":"Ders çok değişkenli fonksiyonlardaki iki derslik dizinin ikincisidir.

This in turns allows us to build more detailed quantitative models of cellular function, which can give important insight into applications ranging from biotechnology to human disease. This course gives a broad overview of a variety of current experimental techniques used in modern systems biology, with focus on obtaining the quantitative data needed for computational modeling purposes in downstream analyses. We dive deeply into four technologies in particular, mRNA sequencing, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, flow/mass cytometry, and live-cell imaging. These techniques are often used in systems biology and range from genome-wide coverage to single molecule coverage, millions of cells to single cells, and single time points to frequently sampled time courses.

In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.\n\nThis course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.\n\n\nCan I earn a Course Certificate if I completed this course before they were available?\nIn order to verify one’s identity and maintain academic integrity, learners who completed assignments or quizzes for Machine Learning prior to November 1st will need to redo and resubmit these assessments in order to earn a Course Certificate.

Why should we have a State?  What kind of State should we have?\n\nEven within a political community, there may be sharp disagreements about the role and purpose of government.  Some want an active, involved government, seeing legal and political institutions as the means to solve our most pressing problems, and to help bring about peace, equality, justice, happiness, and to protect individual liberty.  Others want a more minimal government, motivated, perhaps, by some of the disastrous political experiments of the 20th Century, and the thought that political power is often just a step away from tyranny.  In many cases, these disagreements arise out of deep philosophical disagreements. \n\nAll political and legal institutions are built on foundational ideas.  In this course, we will explore those ideas, taking the political institutions and political systems around us not as fixed and unquestionable, but as things to evaluate and, if necessary, to change.  We will consider the ideas and arguments of some of the world’s most celebrated philosophers, including historical thinkers such as Plato, Hugo Grotius, David Hume, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison, and more contemporary theorists such as Michelle Alexander, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Bryan Caplan, Angela Davis, Ronald Dworkin, Jon Elster, John Hart Ely, H.L.A.

You'll learn fundamental methods of design research that will enable  you to effectively understand people, the sequences of their actions, and the context in which they work. Through the assignments, you’ll learn practical techniques for making sense of what you see and transform your observations into meaningful actionable insights and unique opportunity areas for design.  You’ll also explore how to generate ideas in response to the opportunities identified and learn methods for making your ideas tangible. By answering specific questions and refining your concepts, you’ll move closer to making your ideas real. We’ll use cases from a variety of industries including health, education, transportation, finance, and beyond to illustrate how these methods work across different domains. \n\nGood luck and we hope you enjoy the course!","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/84/1ae16054b711e4b8d11fd5690613d3/hci-large-icon.png","specializations":[],"name":"User Experience: Research & Prototyping","primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["53"]},{"id":"v1-477","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"environmental-science-and-sustainability"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/0b/2816c0352b11e49acdcfd9c2fca6c5/tree-logo-600x340.png","partnerIds":["54"],"description":"In this course you will learn the basics of the life-cycle assessment (LCA) method for holistic environmental analysis of products, technologies, and systems.

Biology is moving from molecular to modular. As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that act as discrete functional systems. These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion, proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems? What are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these systems?\n\nThe course will develop multiple lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations.

Much economic activity takes place in markets with just a handful of very large producers. To understand equilibrium in these oligopoly markets requires more careful attention to strategic interdependence. To capture this interdependence, we consider collusive arrangements among a small number of rivals as well as the use of simple game theoretic techniques to model equilibrium. Market Failure describes situations where markets fail to find the efficient outcome. Information asymmetries are one fertile form of market failure. Another form of market failure occurs when externalities are present.

You will be provided with the most recent evidence from brain-imaging techniques (fMRI, TMS, etc.) and introduced to the explanatory models behind them.\n\nThe course does not require any prior study of economics and neuroscience; however, it might require you to study novel interdisciplinary materials. The course provides an introduction to the methodology, assumptions, and main findings of  Neuroeconomics. Our students have different backgrounds; therefore, I have adapted and simplified the course to allow all students to understand the interdisciplinary content. This course will help you to start your progress in the field of Neuroeconomics and to further develop your skills during other more advanced courses and trainings in the future. For some topics, the course will also provide supplementary videos to reveal the opinions of leading experts in the field. Each module provides optional reading material.\n\nThe course structure is as follows: During each video, you will have to answer some relevant questions. Your answers will not affect your final grade. At the end of each module, you must complete a quiz consisting of 15 questions. To pass the course, you must reach a satisfactory standard in all the course modules by completing all graded quizzes and the final exam. In addition to watching video lectures and taking quizzes, you will receive an invitation to join our forum. We plan to join the discussions in the forum on a weekly basis.\n\nWelcome to Neuroeconomics
