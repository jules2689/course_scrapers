        you ever wondered how a product recommender is built?  How you can infer the
        underlying sentiment from reviews?  How you can extract information from images
        to find visually-similar products to recommend?  How you construct an application
        that does all of these things in real time, and provides a front-end user
        experience?  That’s what you will build in this course!\n\nUsing what you’ve
        learned about machine learning thus far, you will build a general product
        recommender system that does much more than just find similar products  You
        will combine images of products with product descriptions and their reviews
        to create a truly innovative intelligent application.\n\nYou’ve probably heard
        that Deep Learning is making news across the world as one of the most promising
        techniques in machine learning, especially for analyzing image data. With
        every industry dedicating resources to unlock the deep learning potential,
        to be competitive, you will want to use these models in tasks such as image
        tagging, object recognition, speech recognition, and text analysis.  In this
        capstone, you will build deep learning models using neural networks, explore
        what they are, what they do, and how.  To remove the barrier introduced by
        designing, training, and tuning networks, and to be able to achieve high performance
        with less labeled data, you will also build deep learning classifiers tailored
        to your specific task using pre-trained models, which we call deep features.  \n\nAs
        a core piece of this capstone project, you will implement a deep learning
        model for image-based product recommendation.  You will then combine this
        visual model with text descriptions of products and information from reviews
        to build an exciting, end-to-end intelligent application that provides a novel
        product discovery experience.  You will then deploy it as a service, which
        you can share with your friends and potential employers.  \n\nLearning Outcomes:  By
        the end of this capstone, you will be able to:\n   -Explore a dataset of products,
        reviews and images.\n   -Build a product recommender.\n   -Describe how a
        neural network model is represented and how it encodes non-linear features.\n   -Combine
        different types of layers and activation functions to obtain better performance.\n   -Use
        pretrained models, such as deep features, for new classification tasks. \n   -Describe
        how these models can be applied in computer vision, text analytics and speech
        recognition.  \n   -Use visual features to find the products your users want.\n   -Incorporate
        review sentiment into the recommendation.\n   -Build an end-to-end application.\n   -Deploy

        part of the world faces specific vulnerabilities to climate change and has
        different opportunities to mitigate the effects and build resilience in the
        21st century. With the Paris Agreement at COP 21, the global community has
        signaled its intent to act. Indeed, without climate action, decades of development
        progress are threatened, meaning that we are at a ‘make it or break it’ point
        in time. This course presents the most recent scientific evidence, explains
        the different regional impacts and divulge climate action strategies, and
        some opportunities for you to take action on climate change.\n\nAbout the
        Course\n\nThis action-oriented MOOC gives you the opportunity to learn about
        regional climate change impacts and sector-specific strategies to increase
        resilience and move towards a low-carbon future. You will have the opportunity
        to explore these issues in depth and tailor your learning experience for one
        or more of the following regions:\n\n•  Latin America and Caribbean\n•  Sub-Saharan
        Africa\n•  Middle East and North Africa\n•  Eastern Europe and Central Asia\n•  East
        Asia and Pacific\n•  South Asia\n\nTo do this, the MOOC brings together renowned

        evidence on climate change, regional low emissions and climate resilient development
        strategies across sectors, and an overview of the Paris Agreement and other
        outcomes of COP 21.\n\nCourse Syllabus\n\nOverview \n\nTurn Down the Heat:
        From Climate Science to Action is divided into four weeks. The first two weeks
        will provide a comprehensive overview of the scientific evidence for climate
        change, followed by region-specific insights on the impacts of a warmer world
        in the 21st century. The last two weeks will focus on action strategies that
        are being undertaken in different regions and countries to meet the climate
        challenge, and on how individuals can take action.\n\nWeek 1:  Climate Change
        in the 21st Century\n\n•  Historical and projected observed changes in the
        climate system, leading up to the end of the 21st century\n•  The potential
        of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted at COP 21
        from 187 countries to induce climate action\n•  Trends in climate change impacts,
        including loss of Arctic sea ice, melting glaciers, increased heat waves and
        extreme temperatures, and drought and aridity \n•  Possible responses from
        natural systems, explaining how warming could result in sea-level rise, heat
        waves and extreme temperatures, and ocean acidification\n\nWeek 2: Sectoral
        and Regional Impacts\n\n•  Impacts on key development sectors—from warming
        above pre-industrial temperatures and projected climate trends—across each
        of the world’s regions\n•  Sectoral impacts focusing on agricultural production,
        water resources, ecosystem services, and coastal vulnerability for affected
        populations \n•  Importance of risks with the potential to reverse hard-won
        development gains and potentially trap millions in poverty, illustrating the
        need for urgent action now\n\nWeek 3: From Science to Action on Climate Change\n\n•  Region-specific
        discussions on mitigation actions needed to reduce emissions while decreasing
        vulnerability to climate change impacts through adaptation and by building
        climate resilience\n•  Perspectives from regional experts on their experiences
        in strategies and actions proposed in each region to help transition towards
        a low-emissions, climate-resilient development path \n\nWeek 4: What You Can
        Do\n\n•  Transformative impact of day-to-day changes when brought to a global
        scale\n•  The rationale for acting now, acting together and acting differently\n•  Examples
        and expected benefits of mitigation and adaptation policies, considering both
        contributions to global emission reductions and local development opportunities\n\nCourse
        Format\n\nThis MOOC has a week-by-week structure, with resources, activities
        and exercises for you to engage in during each of the four weeks of the course.

        you can discover your personal power as a speaker and give excellent presentations.  \n\nSuccessful
        presentations do not rely on perfect teeth, a deep voice, or an army of scriptwriters.  They
        depend largely on the same skills as successful Business Writing and Graphic
        Design: clarity, structure, and revision. The goal of the course, therefore,
        is to enable you to discover your own internal power as a speaker and express
        it to the world.  After this course, with some practice, you will be able
        to go into any situation and command the room for as long as you like.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-essentials"},{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/84/359f20267311e69594e35d2e0b5815/specialization-logo.jpg","id":"KlAJ6oysEeW79RIwiAyGoQ","slug":"presentation-skills","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["71"],"name":"Successful

        this course we study the ancient, Socratic art of blowing up your beliefs
        as you go, to make sure they''re built to last. We spend six weeks studying
        three Platonic dialogues - \"Euthyphro\", \"Meno\", \"Republic\" Book I -
        then two weeks pondering a pair of footnotes to Plato: contemporary moral
        theory and moral psychology. \n\nPlatonic? Socratic? Socrates was the teacher,
        but he said he never did. Plato was the student who put words in his teacher''s
        mouth. You''ll get a feel for it.\n\nWe have a book: the new 4th edition of
        \"Reason and Persuasion\", by the instructor (and his wife, Belle Waring,
        the translator.) It contains the Plato you need, plus introductory material
        and in-depth, chapter-length commentaries. (Don''t worry! John Holbo knows
        better than to read his book to the camera. The videos cover the same material,
        but the presentation is different.) \n\nThe book is offered free in PDF form
        - the whole thing, and individual chapter slices. It is also available in
        print and other e-editions. See the course content for links and information.\n\nThe
        course is suitable for beginning students of Plato and philosophy, but is
        intended to offer something to more advanced students as well. We seek new,
        odd angles on old, basic angles. Tricky! The strategy is to make a wide-ranging,
        interdisciplinary approach.  Lots of contemporary connections, to make the
        weird bits intuitive; plus plenty of ancient color, still bright after all
        these years. So: arguments and ideas, new possibilities, old stories, fun
        facts. Plus cartoons. \n\nThe results can get elaborate (some book chapters
        and some lesson videos run long.) But each video comes with a brief summary
        of its contents. The lessons progress. I put them in this order for reasons.
        But there''s no reason you can''t skip over and around to find whatever seems
        most interesting. There are any number of self-contained mini-courses contained
        in this 8-week course. You are welcome to them.\n\nPlato has meant different
        things to different people. He''s got his own ideas, no doubt. (Also, his
        own Ideas.) But these have, over the centuries, been worn into crossing paths
        for other feet; been built up into new platforms for projecting other voices.
        (Plato did it to Socrates, so fair is fair.) So your learning outcome should
        be: arrival somewhere interesting, in your head, where you haven''t been before.
        I wouldn''t presume to dictate more exactly.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"philosophy","domainId":"arts-and-humanities"},{"subdomainId":"psychology","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["47"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/2e/abd27b5ded8b660d20c3ae79c1a4d5/courselogo.jpg","name":"Reason

        computer programming to those with little to no previous experience. It uses
        the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy
        to learn, versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals.
        MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing
        moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers.
        The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in
        a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs
        that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent
        program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result,
        MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences,
        through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is
        heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable
        skill in today’s job market.\n\nNevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB
        tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate
        general concepts in computer science and programming. Students who successfully
        complete this course will become familiar with general concepts in computer
        science, gain an understanding of the general concepts of programming, and
        obtain a solid foundation in the use of MATLAB.\n\nStudents taking the course
        will get a MATLAB Online license free of charge for the duration of the course.

        often used in systems biology and range from genome-wide coverage to single
        molecule coverage, millions of cells to single cells, and single time points
        to frequently sampled time courses. We present not only the theoretical background

        you’ll achieve:\nIn this project-centered course* you will build a modern
        computer system, from the ground up. We’ll divide this fascinating journey
        into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary
        logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose
        computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive
        way - how computers work, and how they are designed.\n\nWhat you’ll need:\nThis
        is a self-contained course: all the knowledge necessary to succeed in the
        course and build the computer system will be given as part of the learning
        experience. Therefore, we assume no previous computer science or engineering
        knowledge, and all learners are welcome aboard. You will need no physical
        materials, since you will build the computer on your own PC, using a software-based
        hardware simulator, just like real computers are designed by computer engineers
        in the field. The hardware simulator, as well as other software tools, will
        be supplied freely after you enroll in the course.\n\nCourse format:\nThe
        course consists of six modules, each comprising a series of video lectures,
        and a project. You will need about 2-3 hours to watch each module''s lectures,
        and about 5-10 hours to complete each one of the six projects. The course
        can be completed in six weeks, but you are welcome to take it at your own
        pace. You can watch a TED talk about this course by Googling \"nand2tetris
        TED talk\".\n\n*About Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are
        designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project,
        with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing
        guidance and suggestions along the way. By actively applying new concepts
        as you learn, you’ll master the course content more efficiently; you’ll also
        get a head start on using the skills you gain to make positive changes in
        your life and career. When you complete the course, you’ll have a finished
        project that you’ll be proud to use and share.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"algorithms","domainId":"computer-science"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/32/3b06a1907511e4be1ac3cb2875740d/COURSE_IMAGE.png","id":"ct7G8DVLEeWfzhKP8GtZlQ","slug":"build-a-computer","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["24"],"name":"Build

        is the purpose of government?  Why should we have a State?  What kind of State
        should we have?\n\nEven within a political community, there may be sharp disagreements
        about the role and purpose of government.  Some want an active, involved government,
        seeing legal and political institutions as the means to solve our most pressing
        problems, and to help bring about peace, equality, justice, happiness, and
        to protect individual liberty.  Others want a more minimal government, motivated,
        perhaps, by some of the disastrous political experiments of the 20th Century,
        and the thought that political power is often just a step away from tyranny.  In
        many cases, these disagreements arise out of deep philosophical disagreements.
        \n\nAll political and legal institutions are built on foundational ideas.  In
        this course, we will explore those ideas, taking the political institutions
        and political systems around us not as fixed and unquestionable, but as things
        to evaluate and, if necessary, to change.  We will consider the ideas and
        arguments of some of the world’s most celebrated philosophers, including historical
        thinkers such as Plato, Hugo Grotius, David Hume, Thomas Jefferson, and James
        Madison, and more contemporary theorists such as Michelle Alexander, Kwame

        Hart Ely, H.L.A. Hart, Michael Huemer, Andrew Rehfeld, and Jeremy Waldron.\n\nThe
        aim of the course is not to convince you of the correctness of any particular
        view or political position, but to provide you with a deeper and more philosophically-informed

        programming is becoming increasingly widespread in industry. This trend is
        driven by the adoption of Scala as the main programming language for many
        applications. Scala fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a
        practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with both Java and Javascript.
        Scala is the implementation language of many important frameworks, including
        Apache Spark, Kafka, and Akka. It provides the core infrastructure for sites
        such as Twitter, Tumblr and also Coursera.\n\nIn this course you will discover
        the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them
        usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation
        for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants
        and the tracing of execution symbolically.\n\nThe course is hands on; most
        units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts
        and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course
        is complemented by a series programming projects as homework assignments.\n\nLearning
        Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:\n\n - understand
        the principles of functional programming,\n - write purely functional programs,
        using recursion,\n   pattern matching, and higher-order functions,\n - combine
        functional programming with objects and classes,\n - design immutable data
        structures,\n - reason about properties of functions,\n - understand generic
        types for functional programs\n\nRecommended background: You should have at
        least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal,
        but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby
        is also sufficient.

        its correlation with economic growth - this course is meant for you. The knowledge
        you will gain can truly change your outlook on our world.\n\n\"Economic Growth
        and Distributive Justice -  Maximizing Social Wellbeing\" is the second part
        of a two part course and it includes the following five lectures: \n(1) The
        excess burden of taxation\n(2) Tax incidence: who bears the economic burden
        of tax?\n(3) Progressivity: definition and ways to achieve\n(4) Low Income,
        Low Ability and the Optimal Income Tax Model\n(5) Designing the Tax and Transfer
        System that Maximizes Social Wellbeing\nIf you haven''t done that already,
        we strongly recommend that you register for the first part of the course:
        \"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - the Role of the State\". Taking
        both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive
        knowledge about Economic Growth and Distributed Justice.\n\nThe course is
        founded upon the elemental idea that the role of the state is to maximize
        the well-being - or simply the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating,
        edifying lessons, using only simple words and decoding professional terminologies
        that sometimes baffle the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths
        – both intuitive and unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe,
        it does not however focus on policies in any particular region of the world,
        and is directly applicable to all countries around the globe.\n\nThe course
        touches upon the essence of important concepts like efficiency and equity,
        inequality and poverty, gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning;
        it presents the work of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers -
        promoting a coherent system that integrates tax and government expenditures
        to maximize social welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues
        from their economic angle:\n• Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as
        public goods, and how smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the
        rapidly increasing threats to our planet;\n• Technology as the engine of economic
        growth;\n• Taxing the rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem?
        Should we   impose a global tax on capital?\n\nThe curriculum includes interviews
        with major figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard''s Elhanan
        Helpman, Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago
        and NYU.\n\nAfter successfully completing this course, you can expect to be
        able to:\n• better understand economic issues presented in the media\n• form
        an informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic
        policies\n• define and measure inequality and poverty\n• define the connection
        between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth\n• explain the foundations
        of economic growth\n• design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness
        of individuals\n\nAll these will allow you to better understand the policies
        being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their
        development, as a conscientious citizen.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"law","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f4/d44a90ad3a11e5a1295552b2c67443/Economic-Growth-_-Distributive-Justice.jpg","id":"DJfupMVPEeWLqBIulHpzDw","slug":"economic-growth-part-2","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["110"],"name":"Economic

        the changing influence of interest rates; the impact of interest rates on
        consumption, investment and economic growth; and the bizarre realities of

        blues is an American art form and the most important musical form in jazz.
        Although there are other formal paradigms of the blues, such as 8-bar or 16-bar,
        this course focuses on different incarnations of the 12-bar blues. There are
        considerable differences between Early Jazz blues, Swing blues, Bebop blues,
        Modal blues, and Post Bop blues. Each type has its unique harmonic syntax,
        melodic vocabulary and, associated with them, improvisational techniques.
        While other aspects of jazz performance practice have been constantly changing
        from one stylistic convention to another, the blues has never lost its identity
        and expressive power, and continues to exert a powerful influence on the harmonic
        and melodic syntax of jazz.\n\nThis seven-week course explores important aspects
        of the blues, blues improvisation, basic keyboard textures, jazz harmonic
        and melodic syntax. Topics include: (1) Blues Progressions; (2) Blues and
        Other Scales; (3) Improvisational Tools, and others. This course will also
        cover valuable theoretical concepts enabling the student to master the art
        of jazz improvisation. Each topic will be introduced from a practical perspective
        with the clearly stated goal: to improve one’s improvisational skills. Jazz
        improvisation is rooted in spontaneity, creativity, self-expression and, at
        the same time, self-control and order. A unique pedagogical approach based
        on a one-to-one musical interaction conducted with different instrumentalists

        course will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused
        on mammalian cells, their constituents and their functions. Biology is moving
        from molecular to modular. As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression
        deepens and we develop lists of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved
        in cellular processes, we need to understand how these molecules interact
        with each other to form modules that act as discrete functional systems. These
        systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription,
        motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together
        to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion, proliferation and action
        potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems?
        What are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What
        types of experiments inform systems-level thinking? Why do we need computation
        and simulations to understand these systems?\n\nThe course will develop multiple
        lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning
        threads are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments
        that produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations.
        Examples will be discussed to demonstrate “how” cell- level functions arise
        and “why” mechanistic knowledge allows us to predict cellular behaviors leading
        to disease states and drug responses.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"biology","domainId":"life-sciences"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/42/1b8fdf11bde18fd7fed9d2c24d1c03/Introduction_SB_logo_600X340.png","id":"Fq__yk2bEeS5fSIACy-OMw","slug":"systems-biology","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["27"],"name":"Introduction

        this class, we will derive equilibrium outcomes across a variety of market
        structures. We will begin by understanding equilibrium under a market structure
        called Perfect Competition, a benchmark construction. Economists have tools
        to measure the efficiency of market outcomes. We next consider the polar extreme
        of a competitive market: a monopoly market. We will determine the monopoly
        equilibrium price and quantity and efficiency properties. Much economic activity
        takes place in markets with just a handful of very large producers. To understand
        equilibrium in these oligopoly markets requires more careful attention to
        strategic interdependence. To capture this interdependence, we consider collusive
        arrangements among a small number of rivals as well as the use of simple game
        theoretic techniques to model equilibrium. Market Failure describes situations
        where markets fail to find the efficient outcome. Information asymmetries
        are one fertile form of market failure. Another form of market failure occurs
        when externalities are present. We will examine one key externality, pollution,
        and construct a policy prescription to mitigate the negative efficiency impacts
        of this externality.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will
        be able to:\n•\tExplain how different market structures result in different
        resource allocations.\n•\tModel the impact of external shocks to a particular
        market structure and demonstrate the new equilibrium price and quantity after
        the impact of this external shock has played out.\n•\tEvaluate the efficiency
        of an equilibrium. Different market structures produce different levels of
        efficiency.  \n•\tExplain when and why the government might intervene with
        regulatory authority or antitrust litigation to lessen inefficiencies in some
        markets.\n•\tDescribe how information problems can cause inefficient outcomes.\n•\tUnderstand
        externalities and consider optimal government response to these market failures.\n\nThis

        course is for you if you are interested in transitioning toward a managerial
        role in cybersecurity and mobility. Through interviews with industry experts
        in this area, you will be able to analyze innovations powering the rapid spread
        of information technology and how they present new challenges for protecting
        data. For example, mobile devices increase convenience but often bypass traditional
        security measures. After this course, you will be able to describe how the
        nature of the threat evolves, as culprits employ a burgeoning set of sophisticated
        tools to take advantage of our growing reliance on networks for critical-data
        exchange.\n\nIf you want to pursue a career in the public sector, the stakes
        are high as well. The proliferation of hackers, inevitable human errors, bring-your-own-device
        (BYOD) initiatives, and the ever-broadening need to share information weigh
        heavily on government and education organizations, and consume substantial
        resources. The Pentagon, for example, has proposed to spend $23 billion on
        network security initiatives through 2018. This sounds like a large sum, until
        you consider the scope and importance of the U.S. government information resources
        this investment must protect.\n\nAfter completing the course modules you will
        be able to explain how yesterday’s prevention strategies are no longer adequate
        for stopping advanced, targeted attacks. Today, effective cybersecurity must
        be multi-dimensional and tiered, as threats can originate from virtually anywhere,
        target numerous levels of an organization, and sometimes persist for months
        or years before an information security staff is aware of an attack or breach.

        psychology, and neuroscience are converging today into a unified discipline
        of Neuroeconomics with the ultimate aim of creating a single, general theory
        of human decision-making. \n\nNeuroeconomics provides biologists, economists,
        psychologists and social scientists with a deeper understanding of how they
        make their own decisions and how others decide. Neuroscience, when allied
        with psychology and economics, creates powerful new models to explain why
        we make decisions. Neurobiological mechanisms of decision-making, decisions
        under risk, trust and cooperation will be central issues in this course. You
        will be provided with the most recent evidence from brain-imaging techniques
        (fMRI, TMS, etc.) and introduced to the explanatory models behind them.\n\nThe
        course does not require any prior study of economics and neuroscience; however,
        it might require you to study novel interdisciplinary materials. The course
        provides an introduction to the methodology, assumptions, and main findings
        of  Neuroeconomics. Our students have different backgrounds; therefore, I
        have adapted and simplified the course to allow all students to understand
        the interdisciplinary content. This course will help you to start your progress
        in the field of Neuroeconomics and to further develop your skills during other
        more advanced courses and trainings in the future. For some topics, the course
        will also provide supplementary videos to reveal the opinions of leading experts
        in the field. Each module provides optional reading material.\n\nThe course
        structure is as follows: During each video, you will have to answer some relevant
        questions. Your answers will not affect your final grade. At the end of each
        module, you must complete a quiz consisting of 15 questions. To pass the course,
        you must reach a satisfactory standard in all the course modules by completing
        all graded quizzes and the final exam. In addition to watching video lectures

        health care for veterans has become a matter of national attention and has
        gained increasing attention from the medical community.  With the current
        surge of veterans reintegrating into civilian society it is critical to improve
        the training of the next cadre of providers who will provide care for our
        veterans.  It is widely known that veterans receive care in all aspects of
        the health system, thus providers in  veteran focused care facilities, military
        health serves and civilian locals must be aware of the unique needs of veterans.  It
        is perhaps even more important to educate civilian providers who may be unfamiliar
        with the unique physical, mental and emotional needs related to military service.\n\nCourse

        professionals, or simply interested in the European Union and/or European
        Business Law. The series is ideal for entrepreneurs and businessmen/women
        who plan to work or do business in a European context and want to sharpen
        their competitiveness. For lawyers it is a great course to take in order to
        refresh European Union law or to gain an understanding of law in the context
        of European business. Those preparing for a legal career will also benefit
        from the course as it gives a good understanding of European Union law while
        including lectures by some of the most leading academics and practitioners
        in the field. \n\nPrior knowledge of law and the European Union is an advantage,
        but not a prerequisite. If you have taken our introductory course on Understanding
        the EU Fundamentals you might however have a bit of head start.\n\nAbout the
        Series\n\nThe Lund series in European Business Law ranges from considering
        the basic structures and principles of the European Union to focusing on specialized
        areas of European Union law. The first course, Understanding the Fundamentals,
        examines the core structures and principles of the European Union. The third
        and final course, Competing in Europe, goes into depth concerning how to compete
        on the internal market and protect your brand, product or invention. All three
        courses can be taken independently or in sequence depending on your needs
        and preferences.\n\nWe are currently working on the third course in the series,
        and it will be launched in September 2016. To keep up to speed on the course
        series, visit our Facebook page at:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/eblmooc/\n\nSyllabus
        and Format\n\nEach course consists of a number of modules where one module
        represents about one week of work. A module includes a number of lectures
        and readings, and finishes with an assessment – a quiz or a peer graded assignment.
        The assessments are intended to encourage learning and ensure that you understand
        the material of the course. Participating in forum discussions is voluntary.
        \n\nFAQ\n\n1. Will I get a certificate after completing this class?\nLearners
        who successfully complete a course in the series will receive a Course Certificate.
        \n\n2. Do I earn Lund credits upon completion of this class?\nThe certificate
        is not part of a formal qualification from Lund University. \n\n3. What resources
        will I need for this class?\nThe learners are not required to purchase a textbook
        since all readings will be provided online. All reading materials are free
        and will be available to use for the duration of the course.  \n\n4. What
        are the learning outcomes of this course and why should I take it?\n\nAt the
        end of this course, you will have a basic understanding of how to: \n\n•\tNavigate
        EU legal sources\n•\tUnderstand the relevant regulations governing the internal
        European Union market \n•\tEstablish and run a company within the European
        Union \n•\tSet up agreements and resolve cross-border disputes\n•\tEmploy
        staff and recognize workers rights and obligations\n•\tComply with tax regulations
        and environmental standards \n•\tSuccessfully analyse EU case law and draft
        case reports\n\n5. Can I contact the course instructors directly?\nThe course
        staff will participate in the discussion forum and welcome questions and comments.
        We encourage the learners to be active and engaged, interacting with other
        participants and sharing ideas.   \n\nLund University\n\nLund University was
        founded in 1668. The Faulty of Law is a modern faculty with an international
        profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. The university
        offers two international Masters: European Business Law and Human Rights Law.
        The former provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the
        theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme
        provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework,
        which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business
        decision-makers. \n\nEducation, research and interaction with the surrounding
        community are the main focus of the Faculty’s work. The connection between
        the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by
        the university, including the university’s MOOC course in European Business
        Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal
        studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active
        lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-essentials"},{"subdomainId":"law","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/af/06eda02b9011e5aeba9977309995f3/Courselogo_EBL.jpg","id":"DAJLDyr8EeWGvAojQA48rw","slug":"eu-law-doing-business","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["199"],"name":"European

        Данный курс направлен на то, чтобы сформировать этот фундамент. Мы обойдёмся
        без сложных формул и доказательств и сделаем упор на интерпретации и понимании
        смысла математических понятий и объектов. \n\nДля успешного применения методов
        анализа данных нужно уметь программировать. Фактическим стандартом для этого
        в наши дни является язык Python. В данном курсе мы предлагаем познакомиться
        с его синтаксисом, а также научиться работать с его основными библиотеками,
        полезными для анализа данных.\n\nВ этом курсе вы познакомитесь с фундаментальными
        математическими понятиями, необходимыми для анализа данных, и получите начальный
        навык программирования на Python. Курс состоит из двух больших частей. Первая
        часть курса – практическая, она посвящена языку программирования Python. Вы
        познакомитесь с синтаксисом и идеологией языка, научитесь писать простые программы.
        Также вы узнаете о библиотеках, которые часто применяются на практике для
        анализе данных, например, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib и Pandas. Вторая часть
        курса посвящена таким разделам математики как линейная алгебра, математический
        анализ, методы оптимизации и теория вероятностей. При этом, упор делается
        на разъяснение математических понятий и их применение на практике, а не на

        course is about how the brain creates our sense of spatial location from a
        variety of sensory and motor sources, and how this spatial sense in turn shapes
        our cognitive abilities.\n\nKnowing where things are is effortless.  But “under
        the hood,” your brain must figure out even the simplest of details about the
        world around you and your position in it.  Recognizing your mother, finding
        your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo – these require
        careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains.  This
        course traces the brain’s detective work to create this sense of space and
        argues that the brain’s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting
        the way we think and remember.\n\nThe material in this course is based on
        a book I''ve written for a general audience.  The book is called \"Making
        Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\", and is available from Amazon,
        Barnes and Noble, or directly from Harvard University Press. \n\nThe course
        material overlaps with classes on perception or systems neuroscience, and
        can be taken either before or after such classes.\n\nDr. Jennifer M. Groh,
        Ph.D.\nProfessor\nPsychology & Neuroscience; Neurobiology\nDuke University\n
        www.duke.edu/~jmgroh\n\nJennifer M. Groh is interested in how the brain process
        spatial information in different sensory systems, and how the brain''s spatial
        codes influence other aspects of cognition.  She is the author of a recent
        book entitled \"Making Space:  How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\" (Harvard
        University Press, fall 2014).\n\nMuch of her research concerns differences
        in how the visual and auditory systems encode location, and how vision influences
        hearing.  Her laboratory has demonstrated that neurons in auditory brain regions
        are sometimes responsive not just to what we hear but also to what direction
        we are looking and what visual stimuli we can see.  These surprising findings
        challenge the prevailing assumption that the brain’s sensory pathways remain
        separate and distinct from each other at early stages, and suggest a mechanism
        for such multi-sensory interactions as lip-reading and ventriloquism (the
        capture of perceived sound location by a plausible nearby visual stimulus).\n\nDr.
        Groh has been a professor at Duke University since 2006.  She received her
        undergraduate degree in biology from Princeton University in 1988 before studying
        neuroscience at the University of Michigan (Master’s, 1990), the University
        of Pennsylvania (Ph.D., 1993), and Stanford University (postdoctoral, 1994-1997).  Dr.
        Groh has been teaching undergraduate classes on the neural basis of perception
        and memory for over fifteen years.  She is presently a faculty member at the
        Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences
        at Duke University.  She also holds appointments in the Departments of Neurobiology
        and Psychology & Neuroscience at Duke.\n\nDr. Groh’s research has been supported
        by a variety of sources including the John S. Guggenheim Foundation, the National
        Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval

        cours propose une introduction à la protection internationale des droits de
        l’homme. Il en présente les sources, les catégories, le contenu et les limites
        qui leur sont opposables, ainsi que les obligations qu’ils génèrent à la charge
        des Etats. Il expose aussi les principaux mécanismes de mise en œuvre prévus
        au niveau universel et régional pour assurer leur respect. \n\nDepuis la fin
        de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, les droits de l’homme sont un domaine en plein
        essor. De nombreuses causes sont aujourd’hui défendues et débattues sous la
        bannière des droits de l’homme : la protection des minorités, la lutte contre
        la discrimination des femmes, des personnes lesbiennes, gaies, bisexuelles
        et transgenres (LGBT), la lutte contre la torture et les disparitions forcées,
        la lutte contre la pauvreté ou encore la protection de l’environnement et
        la protection des données. Partout dans le monde, ces causes mobilisent tant
        les acteurs politiques que la société civile et elles sont discutées dans
        de multiples enceintes, nationales et internationales.\n\nLe présent cours
        vise à offrir les bases nécessaires pour appréhender et comprendre le domaine
        vaste et complexe que sont devenus les droits de l’homme. Quelles sont les
        caractéristiques et les différentes catégorie des droits de l’homme ? Quels
        sont leurs fondements philosophiques et historiques ? Pourquoi ces droits
        sont-ils importants ? Quels instruments visent à les protéger ? Comment rendre
        ces droits opérationnels ? Quels mécanismes existent pour les mettre en œuvre
        et quels sont leurs avantages et leurs inconvénients ?\n\nEn abordant ces
        questions, le cours s’adresse tant à des membres de la communauté universitaire
        qu’à des praticiens (responsables politiques, membres du corps diplomatique,
        fonctionnaires, journalistes, membres d’ONG, défenseurs des droits de l’homme
        et spécialistes de la coopération au développement, de l’aide humanitaire
        et des questions relatives aux réfugiés), ainsi qu’à toutes les personnes
        qui sont engagées dans la protection des droits de l’homme ou simplement désireuses
        de mieux comprendre ce phénomène.\n\nLe cours est conçu et dispensé par les
        Professeurs Maya Hertig Randall et Michel Hottelier, de la Faculté de droit
        de l’Université de Genève. Durant le cours, des membres d’organes et institutions
        voués à la protection des droits de l’homme et des spécialistes de la communauté
        académique seront invités à intervenir.\n\nLe cours est donné en français.
        Il consiste en une série de 8 sessions, comprenant chacune un certain nombre
        de brèves présentations vidéo (8 à 15 minutes). Chaque session s''accompagne
        d''un questionnaire d''évaluation. Des lectures préparatoires sont requises

        las regiones del mundo se enfrentan a vulnerabilidades concretas ante el cambio
        climático y tienen diversas oportunidades de mitigar los efectos y aumentar
        su resiliencia en el siglo XXI. La comunidad internacional ha expresado su
        intención de actuar al respecto mediante el Acuerdo de París en la 21ª Conferencia
        de las Partes en la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio
        Climático. De hecho, décadas de avances en desarrollo se ven amenazadas si
        no se adoptan medidas contra el cambio climático, lo que significa que nos
        encontramos en un momento de «ahora o nunca». Este curso presenta las pruebas
        científicas más recientes sobre el cambio climático, explica los distintos
        efectos de alcance regional y difunde estrategias de acción contra el cambio
        climático, así como oportunidades para que pueda tomar medidas en relación
        con el cambio climático.\n\nAcerca del curso\n\nEste MOOC orientado a la acción
        le brindará la oportunidad de conocer los efectos del cambio climático a escala
        regional y las estrategias sectoriales específicas utilizadas para aumentar
        la resiliencia y avanzar hacia un futuro con bajas emisiones de carbono. Tendrá
        la oportunidad de estudiar a fondo estas cuestiones y adaptar su experiencia
        de aprendizaje a una o varias de las siguientes regiones:\n\n•\tAmérica Latina
        y el Caribe\n•\tÁfrica Subsahariana\n•\tOriente Medio y Norte de África\n•\tEuropa
        Oriental y Asia Central\n•\tAsia Oriental y el Pacífico\n•\tAsia Meridional\n\nPara
        ello el MOOC reúne a reconocidos científicos y responsables políticos que
        ofrecerán un resumen de las últimas pruebas científicas sobre el cambio climático,
        estrategias de desarrollo con bajas emisiones de carbono y capacidad de adaptación
        al cambio climático a escala regional entre sectores, así como un análisis
        del Acuerdo de París y otros de los resultados de la 21ª Conferencia de las
        Partes.\nPrograma del curso\n\nDescripción \n\nBajemos la temperatura: La
        ciencia climática pasa a la acción se divide en cuatro semanas. En las primeras
        dos semanas se presentará una visión global de las pruebas científicas del
        cambio climático, que irá seguida de perspectivas específicas de cada región
        sobre los efectos de un aumento de la temperatura en el mundo en el siglo
        XXI. Las últimas dos semanas se centrarán en las estrategias de acción emprendidas
        en distintas regiones y países para abordar el desafío climático, y sobre
        cómo puede actuar la población de manera individual.\n\nSemana 1:  El cambio
        climático en el siglo XXI\n\n•\tCambios históricos y previstos observados
        en el sistema climático en los últimos años del siglo XXI.\n•\tEl potencial
        de contribución prevista determinada a nivel nacional (CPDN) presentada en
        la 21ª Conferencia de las Partes por parte de 187 países para inducir a la
        acción climática.\n•\tTendencias de los efectos del cambio climático, entre
        otros la pérdida de la capa de hielo del Ártico, el deshielo de los glaciares,
        el aumento de las olas de calor y las temperaturas extremas, la sequía y la
        aridez. \n•\tLas posibles respuestas de los sistemas naturales, explicando
        cómo el calentamiento podría dar lugar al aumento del nivel del mar, a olas
        de calor y temperaturas extremas, y a la acidificación de los océanos.\n\nSemana
        2: Efectos de alcance sectorial y regional\n\n•\tRepercusiones en sectores
        clave del desarrollo —desde el calentamiento por encima de la temperatura
        de la época preindustrial y tendencias climáticas previstas— en cada una de
        las regiones del mundo.\n•\tRepercusiones sectoriales centradas en la producción
        agrícola, los recursos hídricos, los servicios de los ecosistemas y la vulnerabilidad
        de las zonas costeras para las poblaciones afectadas. \n•\tImportancia de
        los riesgos que pueden invertir los logros de desarrollo obtenidos con tanto
        esfuerzo y atrapar en la pobreza a millones de personas, ilustrando la necesidad
        de actuar ya con urgencia.\n\nSemana 3: La ciencia climática pasa a la acción
        en materia de cambio climático\n\n•\tDebates sobre regiones específicas en
        torno a las acciones de mitigación necesarias para reducir las emisiones a
        la vez que se disminuye la vulnerabilidad ante los efectos del cambio climático
        por medio de la adaptación y el aumento de la resiliencia al clima.\n•\tPerspectivas
        de expertos regionales sobre sus experiencias con estrategias y acciones propuestas
        en cada región para contribuir a la transición hacia una senda de desarrollo
        con bajas emisiones y resiliente al clima. \n\nSemana 4: Qué puede hacer\n\n•\tEfecto
        transformador de los cambios diarios a escala mundial\n•\tLa razón de actuar
        ahora, actuar juntos y actuar de un modo diferente\n•\tEjemplos y beneficios
        esperados de las políticas de mitigación y adaptación, teniendo en cuenta
        las contribuciones a las reducciones de las emisiones a escala mundial y las
        oportunidades de desarrollo a escala local\n\nAparte de los principales recursos

        just write poems when you can write better ones? This course is built on the
        notion that the most exciting writing begins after the first draft. It is
        specifically for folks who believe that writing poems just to express oneself
        is like using the Internet just for email. After all, poetry can change the
        way you and your readers think of the world and its inhabitants; it can break
        new ground for language; turn a blank sheet of paper into a teeming concert
        of voices and music.\n\nThough any of us may have the potential to make that
        happen, having an understanding of how several tools of poetic composition
        can be used (and audaciously “mis-used”) gives you more ways to try (and if
        we do this right, we might surprise ourselves most of all). \n\nWe''ll cover
        key poetic terms and devices by studying poems by a handful of modern and
        contemporary poets and then get a chance to try our own hand at writing new
        poem drafts from a select number of prompts. Throughout the course you will
        have the opportunity to workshop your poem drafts and get feedback on your
        work, working towards a more polished poem.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"music-and-art"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["59"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d2/54cc3088bc11e588558b26396cd2c9/Kearney_Course_Logo_square.jpg","name":"Sharpened

        Law in Action explains the functions of each international court and tribunal
        present in The Hague, and it looks at how these institutions address contemporary

        and lawyers, you will explore the role of these courts and tribunals and their
        potential to contribute to global justice. \n\nThe first module of the course
        will investigate how judicial settlement is different from other more political
        forms of dispute settlement, such as negotiation and mediation. It offers
        a brief historical overview and introduces the judicial and arbitral bodies
        based in The Hague. In the remaining modules you will learn about the functions
        of these courts and tribunals, and some of the challenges and prospects that
        they face. Three cross-cutting themes tie together all of these modules: (i)
        The interaction between law and politics; (ii) The continuing role of State
        consent; and (iii) The ability of international courts and tribunals to protect
        the public interest and global values.\n\nThis course offers you an opportunity
        to gain a better insight into the functions and features of the courts and
        tribunals present in The Hague. You will gain a familiarity with each court
        or tribunal. You will develop realistic expectations of their capacity to
        address contemporary problems and an awareness of their limitations. You will
        also be able to discuss some of their most prominent cases. \n\nIf you would

        negociamos diariamente. A nivel personal, negociamos con amigos, familia,
        propietarios, vendedores de autos y empleadores, entre otros. La negociación
        también es la clave del éxito comercial. Ninguna empresa puede sobrevivir
        sin contratos rentables. Dentro de una empresa, las habilidades de negociación
        lo pueden llevar a avanzar en su carrera. \n\nEn este curso, aprenderá y practicará
        los cuatro pasos necesarios para lograr una negociación exitosa, con un módulo
        para cada paso: \n(1) Preparación: Planifique su estrategia de negociación
        \n(2) Negociación: Use las tácticas claves para el éxito \n(3) Cierre: Cree
        un contrato \n(4) Cumplimiento y evaluación: El juego final \n\nPara completar
        exitosamente este curso y mejorar su capacidad de negociar, deberá completar
        los tres pasos siguientes: \n(1) Mire los videos breves (que van de 5 a 20
        minutos) de cada módulo. Los videos son interactivos e incluyen preguntas
        para evaluar su entendimiento de las estrategias y habilidades de negociación.
        Los videos se pueden acelerar o ralentizar para adaptarse al ritmo que prefiera
        escucharlos. Según sus horarios, puede ver los videos en unas semanas o verlos
        todos juntos. Un estudiante que vio el curso de una sola vez concluyó que
        \"es tan bueno como Breaking Bad\". \n(2) Complete la negociación del Módulo
        6 para evaluar sus capacidad de negociación. Puede negociar con un amigo local
        o usar los Debates para encontrar un socio de otra parte del mundo. Su socio
        de negociación le brindará una devolución sobre sus capacidad de negociación.
        En el camino, puede resultarle útil utilizar esta aplicación móvil gratuita
        que está relacionada con el curso y contiene varias herramientas de planificación
        de la negociación. http://negotiationplanner.com/ \n(3) Tome el examen final.
        Para completar el curso exitosamente, debe responder correctamente el 80 %
        de las preguntas. Este examen es un examen de dominio, lo que significa que
        puede tomarlo las veces que quiera hasta que domine el material. \n\nAdemás,
        este curso incluye la opción de obtener un Certificado verificado (CV) a través
        de la verificación de su identidad y la finalización exitosa del curso. Un
        CV le proporciona un reconocimiento formal de sus logros en el curso e incluye
        el logo de la Universidad de Michigan. \n\nSi usted está considerando obtener
        un CV, debe completar el proceso de verificación antes de tomar el examen
        final. Puede elegir pagar los cargos asociados antes o después del examen.

        Course\n\nThis course brings together two key subjects, International Marketing
        and Cross Industry Innovation. It will provide the basic foundations of international
        marketing and then explain how companies can grow by going abroad or sourcing
        ideas/expanding into other countries or industries. This is summarized as
        CCCI: Cross-Country and Cross-Industry Innovation, a term and analytical platform
        used throughout not only this course but others in the specialization. As
        an introductory course, we keep the concepts short and simple in order to
        ease learners into the wonderful world of international marketing. More specific
        operational aspects such as managing the product, price, place and promotion
        as well as targeting and positioning will be provided in the second course
        of the specialization. \n\nAfter you successfully complete this course learners
        will obtain the following outcomes:\n\n(1) an understanding of the core meaning
        of marketing and international marketing. \n(2) learn that international marketing
        is about striking the right balance between maximizing the similarities across
        cultures (Etic approach) and customizing marketing (Emic approach) to important
        local differences.\n(3) learn about how to source or expand into other industries
        at home or abroad via cross industry innovation.\n(4) obtain a solid foundation
        for subsequent courses such as course 2 (International Marketing Entry and

        Paradoxes of War teaches us to understand that war is not only a normal part
        of human existence, but is arguably one of the most important factors in making
        us who we are. Through this course, I hope that you will come to appreciate
        that war is both a natural expression of common human emotions and interactions
        and a constitutive part of how we cohere as groups. That is, war is paradoxically
        an expression of our basest animal nature and the exemplar of our most vaunted
        and valued civilized virtues. You will learn some basic military history and
        sociology in this course as a lens for the more important purpose of seeing
        the broader social themes and issues related to war. I want you to both learn
        about war, but more importantly, use it as way of understanding your everyday
        social world. So, for example, the discussion of war and gender will serve
        to start you thinking about how expectations of masculinity are created and
        our discussion of nationalism will make clear how easy “us-them” dichotomies
        can be established and (ab)used. I will suggest some readings for you to complement

        uses the lives, ideals and achievements of Theodore, Franklin, and Eleanor
        Roosevelt to create the idea of a Rooseveltian century. It is about doing
        research, analyzing primary sources, and connecting all this information with
        a coherent and logical interpretation. It is an invitation to think critically
        and historically, and it wants to give you a glimpse of what it means to be
        a historian at work. \n\nWe are convinced that the three Roosevelts – the
        3Rs, as we will refer to them throughout this course – profoundly shaped the
        twentieth century. This course shows you why we think so and which paradigms,
        ideas, and sources we use to uphold our claim. But this course also asks you
        to give your opinion, and ground it on your own research findings. \n\nThe
        structure of the course is straightforward: \n- An introductory module gives
        you the biographical information you need to connect the personal stories
        of the 3Rs with the major events of the twentieth century;\n-  Module 2 explains
        how the 3Rs reframed our thinking on security, broadening its meaning and
        reconfiguring the government’s role in providing it; \n- Module 3, focusing
        on equality, shows how the 3Rs changed the relationship between leaders and
        led, rejected laissez-faire economics, and supported a politics of intervention
        to overcome the inequalities that undermined social cohesion;\n- Module 4
        describes how the 3Rs promoted and protected the freedom of ordinary citizens,
        and communicated that as one of their central political goals;\n- Module 5
        summarizes the long-lasting legacies of the 3Rs, and asks for your opinion
        on the Rooseveltian century. Do you agree with this interpretation of our
        recent past – and our possible futures?\n\nThe five modules contain quizzes
        to test your knowledge and understanding, discussion prompts to stimulate

        Кёнигсберга была распространена такая практическая головоломка: можно ли пройти
        по всем мостам через реку Преголя, не проходя ни по одному из них дважды?
        В 1736 году выдающийся математик Леонард Эйлер заинтересовался задачей и в
        письме другу привел строгое доказательство того, что сделать это невозможно.
        В том же году он доказал замечательную формулу, которая связывает число вершин,
        граней и ребер многогранника в трехмерном пространстве. Формула таинственным
        образом верна и для графов, которые называются \"планарными\". Эти два результата
        заложили основу теории графов и неплохо иллюстрируют направление ее развития
        по сей день. \n\nГраф как математический объект оказался полезным во многих
        теоретических и практических задачах. Наверное, дело в том, что сложность
        его структуры хорошо отвечает возможностям нашего мозга: это структура наглядная
        и понятно устроенная, но, с другой стороны, достаточно богатая, чтобы улавливать
        многие нетривиальные явления. Если говорить о приложениях, то, конечно, сразу
        же на ум приходят большие сети: Интернет, карта дорог, покрытие мобильной
        связи и т.п. В основах поисковых машин, таких, как Yandex и Google, лежат
        алгоритмы на графах. Помимо computer science, графы активно используются в
        биоинформатике, химии, социологии.\n\nЭтот курс служит введением в современную
        теорию графов. Мы, конечно, обсудим классические задачи, но и поговорим про
        более недавние результаты и тенденции, например, про экстремальную теорию
        графов. \n\nМатериал изложен с самых основ и на доступном языке. Целью этого
        курса является не только познакомить вас с вопросами и методами теории графов,
        но и развить у неподготовленных слушателей культуру математического мышления.
        Поэтому курс доступен широкому кругу слушателей. Для освоения материала будет
        достаточно знания математики на хорошем школьном уровне и базовых знаний комбинаторики.\n\nКурс
        состоит из 7 учебных недель и экзамена. Для успешного решения большинства
        задач из тестов достаточно освоить материал, рассказанный на лекциях. На семинарах
        разбираются и более сложные задачи, которые смогут заинтересовать слушателя,
        уже знакомого с основами теории графов.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"math-and-logic","subdomainId":"math-and-logic"},{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"computer-security-and-networks"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/1c/7a11e071a611e597e6ed05f6c41ffb/logo.jpg","id":"SifJJ1fVEeWT8xIUiEQHHQ","slug":"teoriya-grafov","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["ru"],"partnerIds":["176"],"name":"Теория

        the principles of management of urban infrastructures in the era of Smart
        Cities. The introduction of Smart urban technologies into legacy infrastructures
        has already resulted and will continue to result in numerous challenges and
        opportunities. This course will help you to make the best out of the introduction
        of these smart technologies in your cities’ legacy infrastructures.  \n\nOver
        the past few years, advancements in the Information and Communication Technologies
        (ICTs) have significantly challenged the traditionally stable landscape of
        urban infrastructure services provision. The result is an increasing interest
        in the transitioning of cities towards so-called “smart cities”- an interest
        expressed both by technology vendors and public authorities. Although such
        “smart technologies” can provide immense opportunities for citizens and for
        service providers alike, the ICTs often act as disruptive innovators of urban
        infrastructure service provision.\n\nIn this MOOC, you will gain a thorough
        understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with “smart urban
        infrastructures” as well as how these infrastructures can be managed in order
        to deliver desirable performance in cities. More precisely, throughout this
        5-week MOOC you will learn about the most important principles for the management
        of smart urban infrastructures as well as about the application of these principles
        to two specific sectors, namely urban transportation and urban energy systems.
        \n\nThe course does not have any pre-requisits. However, in order to make
        the best of this MOOC, we strongly encourage you to enroll in our previous
        MOOC on the Management of Urban Infrastructures which has been widely appraised
        by learners. \n\nThrough this course, students will:\n- Gain a deep understanding
        of the nature of disruptive innovations (smart technologies) in urban infrastructure
        systems;\n- Learn about state-of-the-art strategies that are and can be used
        for “smart infrastructure” solutions in cities, while effectively managing
        the transition from legacy infrastructures to smart systems;\n- Learn about
        the management of the transition phase from legacy infrastructure systems
        to smart cities by supporting innovations while avoiding early lock-in; and\n-
        Understand the potential applications of the materials learned in this course,
        within the context of the management of “smart urban transportation systems”
        as well as “smart urban energy systems”.\n\nClass workload: 2 hours / week","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/bf/5110902cc111e6b57a4f4a1bd67e5c/SmartCities.jpg","id":"AHvXwCwKEeaMjA6stS_New","slug":"smart-cities","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["16"],"name":"Smart

        how debt and equity can be used to finance infrastructure investments and
        how investors approach infrastructure investments!\n\nAccording to the OECD,
        the global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport, electricity
        generation, transmission & distribution, and water & telecommunications totals
        to 71 trillion dollars. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World
        GDP from 2007 to 2030.\nThe European Commission estimated, that by 2020, Europe
        will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments. Between
        2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation
        of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros
        for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy
        transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and
        construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and
        181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the
        targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.\nTraditionally
        investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However,
        severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by
        public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors
        in the business. \n\nThe course focuses on how private investors approach
        infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments.
        \nThe course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the
        most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments.
        The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students
        to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.\nIn the end
        of the course, students will be capable of analyzing a complex transaction,
        identifying the key elements of a deal, and suggesting proper solutions for
        deal structuring from a financial advisor''s perspective.\n\nCourse Format\nThe
        course will consist of lecture videos, readings, and talks given by guest
        speakers. Although we do hope you will attend the entire course, it is possible
        to just focus on single topics.\n\nSuggested Readings\nThe course is designed
        to be self-contained, there are no obligatory readings that must be acquired
        outside of the course. \nFor students interested in additional study material,

        into your browser): https://youtu.be/fPvT_quBVIw\n\nThere are four weeks of
        course content, which require 2-4 hours per week. Each module builds upon
        the previous one, so we strongly suggest you follow the sequence we''ve outlined
        rather than skip ahead or do the course in less time. The course is designed
        to give you an opportunity to learn and share with others, not test what you
        know. There are weekly activity and reflection assignments, but these will
        not be graded. To receive credit for this course, you will need to complete
        the peer-reviewed final assignment.\n\nAs a participant, you will:\n- Watch
        videos that demonstrate natural phenomena and the Exploratorium''s approach
        to teaching and learning \n- Conduct personal investigations by engaging in
        hands-on activities based in those phenomena\n- Reflect and share your experience
        doing activities\n- Discuss and identify challenges and opportunities for
        teaching\n- Devise a lesson of your own based on one or more of the activities\n\nEach
        week, we''ll look at a different light-related topic: We will start by examining
        human visual perception, then take a brief historical tour of our evolving

        течение жизни мы постоянно взаимодействуем с другими людьми. Маленькие дети,
        пытаясь добиться того, чтобы родители купили понравившуюся конфетку, часто
        шантажируют родителей своими слезами. Принимая решение заплакать, ребенок
        рискует — он не знает, как поведут себя папа с мамой. В чуть более взрослом
        возрасте абитуриенты, выбирающие вуз, принимают сложное решение о том, в какие
        университеты подать документы. Ошибка может стоить дорого: при неправильной
        стратегии можно оказаться в слабом университете или вообще остаться без заветного
        студенческого билета. Окончив вуз, юноши и девушки начинают искать работу.
        Перед интервью с работодателем они штудируют статьи в интернете о том, что
        можно и чего нельзя говорить на интервью, — они пытаются найти наилучшую стратегию
        своего поведения, исходя из ожиданий компании, в которую они устраиваются.
        Все эти ситуации объединяет то, что решения, которые принимают одни люди,
        оказывают влияние на других людей. Такие взаимодействия называются стратегическими.
        Именно их изучает теория игр.\n\nЧтобы проанализировать ту или иную реальную
        жизненную ситуацию стратегического взаимодействия и найти оптимальный вариант
        поведения в ней, необходимо сделать две вещи. Во-первых, необходимо формально
        записать ситуацию на языке теории игр, то есть создать модель (игру). Во-вторых,
        после того как модель (игра) составлена, ее необходимо решить. Этому мы будем
        учиться в течение курса. Мы разберем основные виды игр (одновременные и последовательные,
        с совершенной и несовершенной информацией, коалиционные и некоалиционные),
        приведем способы их решения и обсудим их на многочисленных примерах.\n\nКурс
        будет интересен желающим разобраться в том, как конкурируют друг с другом
        несколько компаний и можно ли гарантированно выиграть в шашки, есть ли смысл
        угрожать на переговорах и с кем стоит объединяться в коалиции в парламенте.\n\nFAQ\n\nВ:
        Требуется ли предварительная подготовка для прохождения курса?\nО: Курс является
        базовым, поэтому он не требует специальной подготовки. Для его успешного освоения
        достаточно уверенных знаний курса математики в объеме школьной программы.
        В одном-двух примерах могут пригодиться знания начал математического анализа
        (дифференцирование функций одной переменной, необходимое условие экстремума)
        и знания начал теории вероятностей (понятие математического ожидания случайной
        величины).\n\nВ: Что требуется для успешного окончания курса?\nО: Итоговая
        оценка за курс складывается из результатов 10 оцениваемых тестов. Для успешного
        окончания курса необходимо дать не менее 80 % правильных ответов на каждый
        из этих тестов.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"math-and-logic","subdomainId":"math-and-logic"},{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"primaryLanguages":["ru"],"partnerIds":["160"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/08/eedfc0a4fa11e5a894ad7ff73294ef/logo.png","name":"Теория

        by David Owens at Vanderbilt University and customized for the cultural sector
        with National Arts Strategies, this course is designed to help arts and culture
        leaders create an environment where new ideas are constantly created, shared,
        evaluated and the best ones are successfully put to work.\n\nOne of the toughest
        challenges for any leader is getting traction for new ideas. Winning support
        can be a struggle. As a result, powerful new ideas often get stuck. This is
        especially true in the cultural sector. People involved in arts and culture
        often have little time and even less money for experimentation and risks.
        This course will help those in the performing arts, museums, zoos, libraries
        and other cultural organizations build environments where new management and
        program ideas flourish.\n\nLeading Innovation in Arts & Culture will teach
        you how to make an \"innovation strategy\" a fundamental component of your
        organization''s overall strategy. In this seminar you will learn to:\n\n-
        Analyze constraints on innovation in your organization, foresee obstacles
        and opportunities, and develop a shared vision\n- Develop a process to manage
        the demands of multiple stakeholders, shifting priorities and the uncertainty
        inherent in new initiatives\n- Create a culture for innovation and risk-taking
        that generates new perspectives and challenges existing practice\n- Create
        a strong customer focus within your organization that anticipates customer
        needs\n\nNational Arts Strategies worked with David Owens to customize this
        course for those working in the cultural sector. They based their work on
        David Owens’ Leading Strategic Innovation in Organizations course. This highly
        interactive 8-week course will engage you in a series of class discussions
        and exercises.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"entrepreneurship"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"music-and-art"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["37","227"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a7/4cc520c88511e59c1a01ad7070be44/COURSE_LOGO_SQUARE.jpg","name":"Leading

        has arguably been one of the defining factors of our age. It frequently makes
        headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private business and ordinary
        citizens. And in many parts of the world, it has been one of the most important
        threats to peace, security and stability. But what does this exactly mean?
        What is the nature of this threat? Who or what is threatened, how, by whom
        and why? What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact
        of terrorism and make sure that terrorists do not make headlines and manage
        to scare us?\n\nThese are just a handful of questions that will be addressed
        in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on the essence
        of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to an
        exploration of this phenomenon and the difficulties in defining it. The second
        part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorism studies.
        Since ‘9/11’ terrorism studies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise
        in perceived threats. But what has academia come up with? What theories, assumptions
        and conventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding
        terrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and
        compared with empirical evidence with the aim to either stress their importance
        or to debunk them as myths. The final part looks into the implications and
        possibilities for policy making.\n\nTestimonials of students who completed
        this course:\n\nI''ve been studying one particular aspect of the field for
        about fifteen years now, but lacked the sort of wider context that this course
        has provided. And I''ve made contacts here that I hope will develop into friendships.\n-Charles
        Cameron, 69, Blogger Religious Studies, UK\n\nThis has been a wonderfully
        enriching experience. I have learned a lot, and have especially appreciated
        the worldwide perspectives of the class found in the discussion forum. Being
        in this class has helped me open up the subject to discussion with colleagues
        and friends, which has led to interesting and insightful conversations. The
        class materials were effective and polished. The peer reviewed assignments
        were challenging and fun. This was my first MOOC, but certainly not my last!  \n-Joella
        Givens, 50, GIS Manager at a state government Department of Transportation,
        USA\n\nThe theoretical aspect was similar to the one offered by well respected
        universities for introductory courses on terrorism. For just 5 weeks, I think
        this course covered a lot of ground. Furthermore, I really enjoyed the discussion
        forums. (...)In addition, I found excellent recommendations on books, articles,
        documentaries, all of great quality.\n-Arete Ketekidou, 32, Research/Analyst,
        Greece\n\nI like very much the freedom we have to study, this is the best
        incentive, not only because we can express our ideas on forums freely and
        manage our own time, also because Professor Bakker has not been imposing his
        ideology on this topic. We receive different information to formulate our
        own position.\n-Valeria Hernández Reyes, 28, Environmental Engineer, Mexico","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/29/5d4f6dfbd7b529d18d0c834ace525e/Terrorism-and-Counterterrorism.jpg","id":"A0IYf6jOEeSnlCIAC1EMbw","slug":"terrorism","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["25"],"name":"Terrorism

        такое физика и зачем она нужна? Некоторые люди никогда не задаются таким вопросом.
        Некоторые считают, что физика нужна исключительно для создания различных «девайсов»,
        например холодильников или мобильных телефонов. И они в чем-то правы, ведь
        сказал же Оскар Уайльд, что «Комфорт – это единственное, что может нам дать
        цивилизация».\n\nДля нас физика – это умение видеть и понимать окружающий
        мир, возможность творить то, о чем раньше даже и мечтать было сложно. Мы считаем,
        что для дальнейшего прогресса человечества необходимы ученые-физики, инженеры-физики
        и просто образованные люди. Мы готовы делиться нашими знаниями. \n\nПредлагаемый
        курс «Электростатика и магнитостатика» посвящен рассмотрению ключевых понятий
        этой области: уравнений Максвелла, записанных в статическом случае как внутри
        вещества, так и вне его, энергетических подходов для вычисления сил, действующих
        на объекты, находящиеся электростатическом или магнитном поле, а также рассмотрение
        свойств для постоянных токов.\n\nСразу заметим – курс не очень простой, для
        его освоения слушателям необходимо владеть знаниями по физике в объеме школьной
        программы, основами дифференциального и интегрального исчисления и основами
        векторного исчисления.\n\nВ течение 10 недель вам будут предлагаться для изучения
        видеолекции, физические демонстрации и семинары с разбором задач. Основные
        формулы и тезисы лекций представлены в виде кратких конспектов. Каждая учебная
        неделя содержит тест и 4 задачи для самостоятельного решения. Экзаменационные
        недели включают тест и 5 задач.\n\nВ конце курса у слушателя есть возможность
        решить дополнительную контрольную работу из трёх задач повышенной сложности

        мы отдаём себе отчёт в том, что в наши дни непонимание процессов, происходящих
        в экономике, непростительно для людей, которые хотят добиться успеха в своей
        профессии, даже если она не связана напрямую с экономикой. История экономической
        мысли – это квинтэссенция опыта решения сложных проблем хозяйственной жизни;
        опыта, который складывался в борьбе идей, отражавших конфликтующие социальные
        интересы. Помимо того, что данный курс даст вам представление о том, как эволюционировала
        важнейшая наука, он призван развить критическое экономическое мышление, а
        также кругозор и общую эрудицию, что крайне высоко ценится в современном мире
        и обязательно будет отмечено на собеседовании в любой компании.\n\nВ нашем
        курсе обобщаются уроки выдающихся экономических мыслителей: Адама Смита и
        Карла Маркса, Леона Вальраса и Йозефа Шумпетера, Торстейна Веблена и Николая
        Кондратьева, Джона М. Кейнса и др. Мы будем разбираться в том, как, отвечая
        на вызовы своего времени, они создавали корпус современного экономического
        знания с его возможностями и ограничениями. \n\nДля освоения курса вам не
        потребуется никаких специальных знаний, а для его успешного завершения необходимо
        набрать проходной балл (80%) по всем оцениваемым заданиям.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/55/b1254d747896918be6b9ae8a34e622/History-of-Economics.jpg","id":"Au2vqsblEeWIJRKecECAWw","slug":"istoriya-ekonomicheskoy-mysli","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["ru"],"partnerIds":["160"],"name":"История

        Distinguishing features of the course include: 1) the introduction and use
        of Taylor series and approximations from the beginning; 2) a novel synthesis
        of discrete and continuous forms of Calculus; 3) an emphasis on the conceptual

        frozen into the Universe a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang and brought
        order to the Universe. Yet we still do not know how ordinary matter (atoms)
        survived against total annihilation by Anti-Matter. The expansion of the Universe
        started acceleration about 7 billion years ago and the Universe is being ripped

        big data distributed over a cluster using functional concepts is rampant in

        when it differs from familiar programming models, like shared-memory parallel
        collections or sequential Scala collections. Through hands-on examples in

        depends.”  That is what you’ll hear when asking about the U.S. university
        admission process.  With over 4,000 universities in the United States and
        no standard application system, the U.S. admission process can be confusing
        for everyone, but especially for students applying from other countries.\n\nThis
        course will help international students (non-U.S. citizens) and non-native
        English speakers navigate the U.S. university admission process by offering
        practical information about the documents and pieces that make up a U.S. university
        application.  More importantly, admission officers will discuss how they use
        those pieces to decide who is accepted and who is denied, so that you can
        understand the process beyond the pieces.\n\nBy the end of this course, you
        will understand application basics that include researching schools, creating
        a school list, and establishing an application plan.  This course will not
        answer all of your application questions, but it will teach you to ask the
        right questions of yourself and the universities.  Ultimately, you will have
        all the information you need to start your process the right way, putting
        you on the path to acceptance.\n\n* Please note, while the English Language
        Programs are part of the University of Pennsylvania, this is not a course
        about applying to Penn.  Furthermore, this course is intended for international
        students educated in the national curriculum of their country.  While other
        students are welcome to enroll, the course is not intended for American students
        or students studying in an American, International Baccalaureate, or Advanced
        Placement curriculum.  The course is also intended for students who do not
        have access to university counseling – if you attend a school that offers
        university counseling, your counselor is the best source of information on
        applying to university.  Finally, this course is for undergraduate (Bachelors
        degree) freshmen (students who have not attended any university) applicants.  Undergraduate
        transfer applicants, students who have attended a university, will find some
        of the information helpful, but graduate (Masters and Doctoral) applicants
        will not.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["6"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/8a/393db06a7211e3a78d2df8f25ca875/Screen-Shot-2013-12-21-at-2.00.29-PM.png","name":"Applying

        is a master course given in Moscow at the Laboratory of Algebraic Geometry
        of the National Research University Higher School of Economics by Valery Gritsenko,
        a professor of University Lille 1, France.\nJacobi forms are holomorphic functions
        in two complex variables. They are modular in one variable and abelian (or
        double periodic) in another variable. The theory of Jacobi modular forms became
        an independent research subject after the famous book of Martin Eichler and
        Don Zagier “Jacobi modular forms” (Progress in Mathematics, vol. 55, 1985)
        which was cited more than a thousand times in research papers. This is due
        to many applications of Jacobi forms in arithmetic, topology, algebraic and
        differential geometry, mathematical and theoretical physics, in the theory
        of Lie algebras, etc. The list of mentioned subjects shows that my course
        might be useful for master and Ph.D. students working in different directions.\nMotivated
        undergraduate students can also study this subject. To follow the course one
        has to know only elementary basic facts from the theory of modular forms (for
        example, the paragraphs 1-4 of the chapter VII of Serre’s “A Course in Arithmetic”
        are enough).\nThe main hero of the course is the Jacobi theta-series. Using
        it we will construct a lot of concrete examples of Jacobi forms in one or
        many abelian variables, in particular, Jacobi forms for root systems.\nFor
        some of you, who will be successful with the theoretical exercises of the
        course, I am ready to formulate research problems for Master or Ph.D. thesis.

        half of the course, we investigate DNA replication, and ask the question,

        play the role of molecular clocks.  The cells in your body manage to maintain
        a circadian rhythm, but how is this achieved on the level of DNA?  Once again,
        we will see that by knowing which hidden messages to look for, we can start
        to understand the amazingly complex language of DNA.  Perhaps surprisingly,
        we will apply randomized algorithms, which roll dice and flip coins in order
        to solve problems.\n\nFinally, you will get your hands dirty and apply existing

        Arguments\n\nThink Again: How to Reason and Argue\nReasoning is important.
        This series of four short courses will teach you how to do it well. You will
        learn simple but vital rules to follow in thinking about any topic at all
        and common and tempting mistakes to avoid in reasoning. We will discuss how
        to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians,
        used car salesmen, and teachers) and how to construct arguments of your own
        in order to help you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will
        be useful in dealing with whatever matters most to you.\n\nCourses at a Glance:\nAll
        four courses in this series are offered through sessions which run every four
        weeks. We suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability.
        If for whatever reason you fall behind, feel free to re-enroll in the next
        session.We also suggest that you start each course close to the beginning
        of a month in order to increase the number of peers in the discussion forums
        who are working on the same material as you are. While each course can be
        taken independently, we suggest you take the four courses in order.\n\nCourse
        1 - Think Again I: How to Understand Arguments\nCourse 2 - Think Again II:
        How to Reason Deductively\nCourse 3 - Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively\nCourse
        4 - Think Again IV: How to Avoid Fallacies\n\nAbout This Course in the Series:\nWhen
        is someone giving an argument instead of just yelling? Which parts of what
        they say contribute to the argument? Why are they arguing instead of fighting?
        What are arguments made of? What forms do they take? Think Again: How to Understand
        Arguments will answer these questions a more. \n\nIn this course, you will
        learn what an argument is. The definition of argument will enable students
        to identify when speakers are giving arguments and when they are not. Next,
        we will learn how to break an argument into its essential parts, how to put
        them in order to reveal their connections, and how to fill in gaps in an argument.
        By the end of this course, students will be better able to understand and
        appreciate arguments that they and other people present.\n\nSuggested Readings:\nStudents
        who want more detailed explanations or additional exercises or who want to
        explore these topics in more depth should consult Understanding Arguments:
        An Introduction to Informal Logic, Ninth Edition, Concise, Chapters 1-5, by
        Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin.\n\nCourse Format:\nEach week
        will be divided into multiple video segments that can be viewed separately
        or in groups. There will be short ungraded quizzes after each segment (to
        check comprehension) and a longer graded quiz at the end of the course.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"},{"subdomainId":"philosophy","domainId":"arts-and-humanities"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera.s3.amazonaws.com/topics/thinkagain/large-icon.png","id":"VIUTXB0IEea20BJooCBlFw","slug":"understanding-arguments","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["7"],"name":"Think

        of the phenomena in the world around you are, at the fundamental level, based
        on physics, and much of physics is based on mechanics. Mechanics begins by
        quantifying motion, and then explaining it in terms of forces, energy and
        momentum. This allows us to analyse the operation of many familiar phenomena
        around us, but also the mechanics of planets, stars and galaxies.\n\nThis
        on-demand course is recommended for senior high school and university students,
        science teachers and anyone with a curiosity about basic physics. The course
        uses rich multimedia tutorials to present the material: film clips of key
        experiments, animations and worked example problems, all with a friendly narrator.
        You''ll do a range of interesting practice problems, and in an optional component,
        you will use your ingenuity to complete at-home experiments using simple,
        everyday materials.\n\nYou will need some simple high-school mathematics:
        arithmetic, a little algebra, quadratic equations, and the sine, cosine and
        tangent functions from trigonometry. The course does not use calculus. However,
        we do provide a study aid introducing the calculus that would accompany this
        course if it were taught in a university.\n\nBy studying mechanics in this

        Value Creation. \nIn this first MOOC of the \"Inspirational Leadership\" specialization,
        you will practice the first two steps of the method for successful leadership:
        Introspection and Conversation. You will get to know yourself better during

        Some of the questions you will explore this week are: What is the nonprofit
        sector and why does it exist?  What are the unique characteristics of nonprofit
        organizations? What are the trends and emerging issues facing organizations
        in the nonprofit sector?\n\nWeek 2: Questions to be explored this week are:
        What is leadership at the governance level and how is it different from management?  What
        is good governance and why does it matter? What is a board of directors?\n\nWeek
        3: This week''s questions: What roles do board members play in nonprofit organizations?
        Broadly speaking, what are boards responsible for and how do they go about
        their work? What are some of the issues that challenge the board''s ability
        to go its work?\n\nWeek 4: At this stage, you are asked to review the course
        content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board
        Effectiveness Readiness Assessment), and take two multiple choice Readiness
        Assurance Tests (known similarly as RATs). One RAT will assess knowledge and

        Beginning Game Programming with C# course is all about learning how to develop
        video games using the C# programming language. Why use C# instead of C++,
        Java, ActionScript, or some other programming language you may have heard
        of? First, using C# lets us use the open-source MonoGame framework, which
        help us quickly develop games for Windows, Android, iOS, Mac OS X, and others.
        Second, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers,
        and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment.
        And finally, C# is a really good language for learning how to program.\n\nThat
        learning how to program comment is important because this course doesn''t
        assume you have any previous programming experience. Don''t worry if you''ve
        never written code before; we''ll start at the very beginning and work our
        way up to building a small, complete game by the end of the course. Throughout
        the course you''ll learn core programming concepts that apply to lots of programming
        languages, including C#, and you''ll also learn how to apply those concepts
        when you develop games: drawing all the entities in the game world, updating
        the game world based on user input and simple physics, playing music and sound
        effects in your games, and so on.\n\nComputer programming is really fun in
        general, and programming games is even better!\n\nCaution: Beginning (assuming
        no prior programming knowledge) is not the same as easy (not hard to do).
        Learning to program IS hard to do, especially since this course is essentially
        a freshman-level college course. Meeting the course challenges while you master
        the material will be rewarding to you, but doing that will require hard work
        and maybe even a few expletives along the way.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"software-development"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f4/fc7a006d2bafe837b6de5016d8a423/Course-Logo.png","id":"ZgdEeNmtEeWIyg6KWmLgkQ","slug":"game-programming","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["126"],"name":"Beginning

        1 of this course, we will study the notion of algorithmic efficiency and consider
        its application to several problems from graph theory.  As the central part
        of the course, students will implement several important graph algorithms
        in Python and then use these algorithms to analyze two large real-world data
        sets.  The main focus of these tasks is to understand interaction between
        the algorithms and the structure of the data sets being analyzed by these
        algorithms.\n\nRecommended Background - Students should be comfortable writing
        intermediate size  (300+ line) programs in Python and have a basic understanding
        of searching, sorting, and recursion. Students should also have a solid math

        objective of this course is to encourage a critical understanding of doping.
        To achieve this goal, this course will rely on a multidisciplinary approach
        that allow you to see how different disciplines get into a single object,
        in different perspectives and in often complementary ways. This approach will
        also allow us to appreciate the complexity of a subject like doping.\n\nDoping
        in sports is a complex practice whose definition and identification is the
        result of socially and historically constructed norms.\nThis course offers
        to shed light on the processes that led to the use and prohibition of doping
        substances. Performance enhancement or physical transformation are two aspects
        of doping which are seen as problematic, yet even as we speak companies are
        making fortunes selling body improvement and other forms of “human enhancement”
        to us. These apparent contradictions will be analysed to show that beyond
        sanitary questions, doping raises many social, scientific and legal issues.
        \nIn efforts to control doping, governments and sports authorities have put
        into place institutions responsible for defining what falls into the category
        of doping, but also what prevention, repressions and research methods to put
        into effect. This course will also explore biological control measures such
        as the biological passport, key legal dimensions, organisations that produce
        performance, as well as the sociological dimensions of doping.\n\nBesides
        the Professors of University of Lausanne, the best experts of doping are involved
        in this course: experts from an Anti-doping Laboratory (LAD- Lausanne-Switzerland),
        from the CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport), from the UEFA (soccer), and

        Learning Outcomes\n\nAt the end of the course the participants will be able

        practice linked to the transformation of social norms,\n2.\tGo from a binary
        way of thinking - for or against doping - to an understanding of the complexity
        of this phenomenon which is biological, psychological and sociological, all
        at the same time,\n3.\tRecognize the institutions, the actors and the practices
        of the fight against doping,\n4.\tExplain how the social and organisational

        Fundamentals course will offer educators and enthusiasts an opportunity to
        develop a practice of tinkering and making.  We see tinkering as a serious
        endeavor—one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving
        disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning
        opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational
        field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science
        learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring
        STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high
        and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that
        supports children’s (and adults) self expression.\n\nFor over a decade, the
        Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both
        children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor—spanning
        many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art,
        science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by
        investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them.
        This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any “right” one,
        particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects
        in the classroom. This course centers on circuit-related activities, which
        offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.\n\nIn this course,
        we won’t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we’ll also delve
        into why. We’ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific
        materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We’ll
        also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we’ve developed
        that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school
        science program. Whether you’re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope
        this course will help you take the next step!\n\nOUR APPROACH TO TEACHING\n\nThis
        is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential!
        We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking
        questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is
        a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the
        world and from all walks of life, so don’t be shy!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Although
        this course will not have active instructor participation, we have put a great
        deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration.
        We’ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations
        and experience as learners, designers and facilitators; and hopefully spark
        interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it’s not a
        requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague
        or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities
        with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.\n\nREQUIRED
        COURSE MATERIALS\n\nYou will need several tools and materials to do weekly
        course activities. Pre-bundled materials are available from the Exploratorium
        store at www.artoftinkering.com. Please obtain all materials as soon as possible,
        well in advance of when you will need them in the course. Be sure to allow

        course will allow you to identify and evaluate opportunities for creating
        a tech business, and to better understand its principal issues on a human,
        technical, commercial, environmental and financial level.\n\nAs such, you
        will obtain solid foundations either for building your own tech business,
        or for joining one.\n\nDeciding to create or to join a tech business in these
        early years is an out-of-the-ordinary adventure, and it certainly won’t be
        straightforward: you need to be ready to accept that not all \"good\" ideas
        will lead to success, and that only a very small number of projects lead to
        great success. You must learn to overhaul your relationship with failure,
        which is a valuable source of experience and should be managed according to
        the logic of “acceptable loss”: the entrepreneur loves uncertainty, not excessive
        risk. The creation of tech businesses gives you a genuine opportunity to change
        the world, but requires you to adopt a particular state of mind and to be
        able to acquire knowledge, know-how and interpersonal skills.\n\nYou will
        have the chance to work alongside passionate and exciting people from a whole
        multitude of backgrounds. From a technological point of view, these women
        and men have constructed numerous companies of a global scale.\n\nThe development
        trajectory of a tech business is full of mishaps which require you to be both
        agile and greatly prepared to build on a strong idea, choose your market,
        develop your proposal, assemble a team worthy of the task in hand, and finding
        financing.\n\nThe course is made up of methodological sessions as well as
        first-hand accounts from entrepreneurs and people who have succeeded in creating
        tech businesses themselves. You will thus be able to get to know the essential
        dilemmas with which high-tech business creators are confronted with, beginning
        with the initial decision to set up your very own structure, which itself
        represents a significant life decision.\n\nYou will also see that the creation
        of a tech business is much more a collective adventure than an individual
        one.\n\nIn the English version, all of the reading content, quizzes and assesments
        will be in English, whilst the videos will have French audio and English subtitles.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"entrepreneurship"},{"subdomainId":"finance","domainId":"business"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5e/295f50e16e11e598e2c16de109e815/logo-800x800.png","id":"cS6r05iOEeW5gxKDBxYMJw","slug":"tech-startup","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["66","161"],"name":"Creating

        in, and how we come to have it;\n\nPhilosophy of science, where we’ll investigate
        foundational conceptual issues in scientific research and practice;\n\nPhilosophy
        of Mind, where we’ll ask questions about what it means for something to have
        a mind, and how minds should be understood and explained;\n\nMoral Philosophy,
        where we’ll attempt to understand the nature of our moral judgements and reactions
        – whether they aim at some objective moral truth, or are mere personal or
        cultural preferences, and;\n\nMetaphysics, where we’ll think through some
        fundamental conceptual questions about the nature of reality.\n\nThe development
        of this MOOC has been led by the University of Edinburgh''s Eidyn research
        centre.\n\nTo accompany ''Introduction to Philosophy'', we are pleased to
        announce a tie-in book from Routledge entitled ''Philosophy for Everyone''.
        This course companion to the ''Introduction to Philosophy'' course was written

        готовый реквизит и подмостки, может поставить свою постановку почти бесплатно
        и пригласить зрителей-юзеров с неплохими шансами превратить их в друзей бренда.
        Вы можете разыграть целое представление по вовлечению пользователя в Ваш бизнес.
        \nТеперь каждый предприниматель, используя инструменты инфографики, цифрового
        дизайна, контент- и комьюнити-менеджмента, может стать одновременно драматургом-сценаристом,
        режиссёром, художником-декоратором и актёром  шоу, разыгрываемого перед цифровой
        публикой. \nНаш курс как раз об этом – как сделать так, чтобы Ваша цифровая
        бизнес-постановка снискала успех у зрителя, голосующего за неё звонкой монетой.
        В каком-то смысле это курс драматургии и режиссёрского мастерства, но не обычного,
        а цифрового. \nВ наших лекциях мы расскажем Вам о новом герое этой сцены –
        коллаборативной социалномике или экономике участия, новом зрителе – аудитории
        социальных платформ, новых подмостках – многообразии социальных платформ,
        о том, что происходит за кулисами - как «мониторят» социальные сети,  о новой
        режиссуре как построении стратегии присутствия и продвижения в социальных
        сетях и новой игре, актерах и помощниках сцены – дизайнерах, копирайтерах,

        вероятностей - это, вне всякого сомнения, один из самых важных и богатых приложениями
        разделов современной математики.\n\nС помощью методов этой замечательной науки
        можно как оценивать классические вероятности выигрышных стратегий в азартных
        играх, так и решать весьма серьезные прикладные задачи, возникающие буквально
        в каждой области науки. В нашем курсе мы познакомим слушателей прежде всего
        с самыми основами предмета. И сделаем мы это в уникальном формате - иллюстрируя
        вероятностные объекты и методы на примерах решения с их помощью комбинаторных
        задач. Суть в том, что, конечно, в базовой вероятности много комбинаторики,
        и это все знают; мы же расскажем не только об этом, но и о том, как, наоборот,
        вероятностные методы позволяют работать с комбинаторными задачами. Это позволит
        нам впоследствии выйти на приложения вероятности в теории графов, случайных
        графов и, наконец, веб-графов и прочих сложных сетей. Также в рамках курса
        мы оторвемся от чисто комбинаторных интерпретаций и обсудим более общие вероятностные
        модели. Но интуиция все равно сохранится, и в этой комбинаторной подоплеке
        уникальность курса.\n\nКурс построен так, что будет по плечу даже тем, кто
        изучал математику последний раз только в школе. Тем не менее, так как для
        понимания курса необходимы знания основ комбинаторики, мы рекомендуем пройти
        наш курс по комбинаторике прежде чем прослушивать данный курс.\n\nВнутри курса
        также все просто – каждую неделю вас ждут видеолекции и проверочные задания,
        которые нужно выполнять в срок. В конце – итоговая проверочная работа. Студенты,

        протяжении тысячелетий люди усовершенствовали орудия труда, изучали силы природы
        и подчиняли их себе, использовали их энергию для работы машин, а в прошлом
        веке создали машины, которые могут управлять другими машинами. Теперь создание
        устройств, которые взаимодействуют с физическим миром, доступно даже школьнику.
        \n\nНаш курс состоит из серии практических задач про создание вещей, которые
        работают сами: изучают мир, принимают решения и действуют – двигаются, обмениваются
        данными друг с другом и с человеком, управляют другими устройствами. Мы покажем,
        как собирать эти устройства и программировать их, используя в качестве основы
        платформу Arduino.\n\nПройдя этот курс, вы сможете создавать устройства, которые
        считывают данные о внешнем мире с разнообразных датчиков, обрабатывают информацию,
        получают и отправляют данные на ПК, в Интернет, на мобильные устройства, управляют
        индикацией и движением. Создание устройств будет включать проектирование,
        изучение компонентов, сборку схем, написание программ, диагностику. Попутно
        с созданием самих устройств вы сделаете визуализацию на ПК, создадите веб-страницу,
        которую будет демонстрировать одно из ваших устройств, а также разберетесь
        с устройством и работой FDM 3D-принтера. \n\nПомимо тех, кто увлекается робототехникой
        или стремится расширить кругозор и свои навыки, курс будет полезен всем, кто
        сталкивается с задачами бытовой и производственной автоматизации, а также
        занимается промышленным дизайном, рекламой и искусством.\n\nКурс не требует
        специальных знаний у слушателей, доступен даже ученикам старших классов средней
        школы. Плюсом будут навыки программирования и владение английским языком на
        уровне чтения технической документации, однако обязательным это не является.\n\nВесь
        курс посвящен практике и самым лучшим решением для вас будет раздобыть электронику,
        повторять показанные примеры и экспериментировать самостоятельно.\n\nПриобрести

        nós negociamos diariamente. No nível pessoal, negociamos com amigos, família,
        proprietários do imóvel em que moramos, vendedores de carro, funcionários,
        entre outros. A negociação também é a chave para o sucesso nos negócios. Nenhuma
        empresa consegue sobreviver sem contratos lucrativos. Dentro de uma empresa,
        as habilidades de negociação podem levar a avanços na carreira.\n\nEste curso
        fornece uma introdução prática e holística às estratégias e habilidades que
        podem levar a negociações de sucesso na vida pessoal e nas transações de negócios.
        O curso cobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação: (1) planejamento,
        (2) negociação, (3) criação do contrato e (4) execução do contrato. \n\nCada
        estágio analisa as principais questões que você deverá estar preparado para
        responder em negociações futuras, como:  \n•\tQuais são os principais elementos
        em uma análise de negociação, incluindo o preço de reserva fixado, a meta
        de expansão, alternativas para o negócio em questão e a zona de acordo potencial?\n•\tQue
        diretrizes devem ser seguidas ao confrontar questões de ética?\n•\tQual é
        a sua fonte de poder nas negociações e como é possível aumentar o seu poder?\n•\tQuais
        ferramentas psicológicas podem ser usadas durante as negociações e quais armadilhas
        psicológicas devem ser evitadas?\n•\tQuais são as quatro principais questões
        de lei contratual que devem estar no checklist de negociação?\n•\tQuais conceitos
        e ferramentas podem ser usados ao resolver controvérsias?  \n\nDurante o curso,
        você assistirá a uma série de pequenos vídeos (que vão de 5 a 20 minutos)
        sobre cada estágio da negociação.  Os vídeos são interativos e incluem questões
        para testar o seu entendimento sobre estratégias e habilidades de negociação.
        O curso também inclui vídeos que dramatizam a arbitragem de uma controvérsia
        na área de construção e a mediação de uma controvérsia de software de robótica.
        \n\nDependendo do seu planejamento, pode assistir aos vídeos ao longo de algumas
        semanas ou pode assisti-los todos de uma vez.  Um aluno que assistiu a todos
        os vídeos de uma vez concluiu que \"É uma série tão boa quanto Breaking Bad\".\n\nApós
        assistir aos vídeos sobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação, você
        poderá participar de uma negociação individual que testará as suas qualificações
        como negociador.  Os vídeos finais do curso verificam a sua negociação e revisam
        os conceitos e as ferramentas tratados no curso.  Você também receberá feedback
        sobre o que faz de melhor como negociador e como pode melhorar.\n\nThis is

        fases que abordaremos en el curso son:\n\n 1)  Imaginación (Divergencia):
        a través de esta fase desarrollaremos un pensamiento creativo y crítico por
        medio de la exploración de una diversidad de opiniones en cuanto a diferentes
        megatendencias sociales, tecnológicas y de consumo. También utilizaremos una
        herramienta conocida como “Un día en la vida de …” para identificar áreas

        Studies: Analyzing Sentiment & Loan Default Prediction\n\nIn our case study
        on analyzing sentiment, you will create models that predict a class (positive/negative
        sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...).  In
        our second case study for this course, loan default prediction, you will tackle
        financial data, and predict when a loan is likely to be risky or safe for
        the bank. These tasks are an examples of classification, one of the most widely
        used areas of machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including
        ad targeting, spam detection, medical diagnosis and image classification.
        \n\nIn this course, you will create classifiers that provide state-of-the-art
        performance on a variety of tasks.  You will become familiar with  the most
        successful techniques, which are most widely used in practice, including logistic
        regression, decision trees and boosting.  In addition, you will be able to
        design and implement the underlying algorithms that can learn these models
        at scale, using stochastic gradient ascent.  You will implement these technique
        on real-world, large-scale machine learning tasks.  You will also address
        significant tasks you will face in real-world applications of ML, including
        handling missing data and measuring precision and recall to evaluate a classifier.  This
        course is hands-on, action-packed, and full of visualizations and illustrations
        of how these techniques will behave on real data.  We''ve also included optional
        content in every module, covering advanced topics for those who want to go
        even deeper! \n\nLearning Objectives: By the end of this course, you will
        be able to:\n   -Describe the input and output of a classification model.\n   -Tackle
        both binary and multiclass classification problems.\n   -Implement a logistic
        regression model for large-scale classification.  \n   -Create a non-linear
        model using decision trees.\n   -Improve the performance of any model using
        boosting.\n   -Scale your methods with stochastic gradient ascent.\n   -Describe
        the underlying decision boundaries.  \n   -Build a classification model to
        predict sentiment in a product review dataset.  \n   -Analyze financial data
        to predict loan defaults.\n   -Use techniques for handling missing data.\n   -Evaluate
        your models using precision-recall metrics.\n   -Implement these techniques
        in Python (or in the language of your choice, though Python is highly recommended).","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"machine-learning","domainId":"data-science"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b1/37a1a04d0011e59bd777c2a1ef6a6e/gears-818461_1280.jpg","id":"3c1bSkIJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ","slug":"ml-classification","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["15"],"name":"Machine

        – интересно – просто – понятно!\nДанный курс представляет собой серию физических
        опытов и экспериментов по теории колебаний и основам молекулярной физики.
        Демонстрацию физических явлений проводит легендарная личность, незаурядный
        преподаватель, доцент кафедры общей физики НИЯУ МИФИ — Валериан Иванович Гервидс,
        который доступно и наглядно объясняет основные принципы и законы общей физики.
        \n\nЗачем учить этот курс?\n• Физика – наука экспериментальная. Лучше один
        раз увидеть, чем сто раз услышать или прочитать! \n• Именно эксперименты позволяют
        продемонстрировать и легко понять и простые, и сложные аспекты, которые традиционно
        преподаются в виде теоретического материала и математических моделей\n• Курс
        поможет Вам научиться использовать: \n   o эксперимент как способ постановки
        вопроса, \n   o эксперимент как инструмент изучения физического явления\n   o
        эксперимент как  форму ответа на вопрос\n• Очень часто достаточно «простые»
        физические вопросы имеют неожиданные ответы, которые зависят от конкретных
        условий проведения эксперимента. Демонстрация таких опытов и объяснение полученных
        в них результатов могут оказаться чрезвычайно интересными\n• Вы сможете увидеть
        применение изучаемых физических явлений в жизни, в технике и в быту\n• Изучая
        этот курс, вы восполните нехватку времени на экспериментальную, «живую» физику,
        которая ощущается в обычном учебном процесс\n\nЧему учит этот курс?\n• Пониманию
        широкого круга как простых, так и сложных физических явлений и процессов по
        тематике соответствующих разделов\n• Применению физических закономерностей
        для анализа различных физических явлений и процессов \n• Навыкам  использования
        эксперимента\n• Базовым знаниям по физике будущих инженеров и специалистов
        в различных областях деятельности.\n\nДля кого этот курс?\n• Для тех, кто
        изучает физику, и хочет прояснить для себя различные вопросы (в школе, в вузе)\n•

        to effectively \"manage oneself\" (P. Drucker). \n\nIn this course, you will
        learn how to think strategically and professionally about your career self-management.
        Through this course you''ll develop an objective, external view of your marketable
        skills as a solid foundation for building a strong career brand. In particular,
        you''ll be able to:\n\n-  explain why developing a protean and boundaryless
        career perspective based on transferable (portable) skills is advantageous
        for continuing employability and career growth; \n-  design your portable
        skills portfolio, identify and examine critically important competencies underpinning
        your transferable skills, and analyze your career self-management competency
        gaps;\n- increase self-awareness, pinpoint your career goals, and envision
        your future work self; \n- recognize the central role of self-management for
        developing transferable, marketable, skills and create a customized self-management
        information system (Career Development Lab) for ongoing personal development
        and professional growth;\n- conduct a thorough, competency-based job analysis
        in your area of interest and examine practices of evidence-based, data-driven
        competitive employee selection; \n-implement your newly developed skills for
        crafting effective selection criteria statements and refining your job applications.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/db/998fa0b27511e5bfec591131c93482/College-Photos-_OCGR_-010_2.jpg","id":"mqcQFm6vEeWJ-wrnmCvZZw","slug":"strategic-career-self-management","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["117"],"name":"Strategic

        course is an introduction to high-throughput experimental methods that accelerate
        the discovery and development of new materials.\n\nIt is well recognized that
        the discovery of new materials is the key to solving many technological problems
        faced by industry and society.  These problems include energy production and
        utilization, carbon capture, tissue engineering, and sustainable materials
        production, among many others.  This course will introduce the learner to
        a remarkable new approach to materials discovery and characterization: high-throughput
        materials development (HTMD).  \n\nEngineers and scientists working in industry,
        academic or government will benefit from this course by developing an understanding
        of how to apply one element of HTMD, high-throughput experimental methods,
        to real-world materials discovery and characterization problems.  Internationally
        leading faculty experts will provide a historical perspective on HTMD, describe
        preparation of ‘library’ samples that cover hundreds or thousands of compositions,
        explain techniques for characterizing the library to determine the structure
        and various properties including optical, electronic, mechanical, chemical,
        thermal, and others.  Case studies in energy, transportation, and biotechnology
        are provided to illustrate methodologies for metals, ceramics, polymers and
        composites.\n\nThe Georgia Tech Institute for Materials (IMat) developed this
        course in order to introduce a broad audience to the essential elements of
        the Materials Genome Initiative.  Other courses will be offered by Georgia
        Tech through Coursera to concentrate on integrating (i) high-throughput experimentation
        with (ii) modeling and simulation and (iii) materials data sciences and informatics.\n\n\nAfter

        about behavior change in public health, we often focus on the individual mother,
        student, or farmer. We should not forget the community structure and norms
        constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors. This course examines
        the community context of the changes needed to promote the public’s health.
        We begin by examining the various definitions of ‘community’ and the processes
        by which we ‘diagnose’ or seek to understand the structure and characteristics
        of different types of communities.\n\nAn appreciation of community similarities
        and differences is necessary lest we fall into the trap of designing one-size-fits-all
        interventions. We need to recognize that no matter that outsiders may view
        a community as poor or neglected, we can find strengths and capacities for
        improvement in each community. Identifying community capacities and resources
        is the first step in facilitating community change. Different practical and
        philosophical approaches to change and therefore, examined. Specific to the
        change process is our recognition of the need for communities to participate
        in the design, implementation and evaluation of any intervention.\n\nWe examine
        the concept of participation in an effort to see how different levels of involvement
        may affect sustainability of community change efforts. Finally a case study
        of a community participatory approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa
        is presented. Community Directed Intervention has subsequently been successfully
        applied to providing other essential primary health care services by and in

        are the determinants of a happy and fulfilling life?\n\nThis is surely one
        of life’s biggest questions, and a question that has interested many of our
        ancestors. Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several
        Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had
        their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our
        own theories about happiness too.\n\nHow valid are our theories?\n\nTill recently,
        if you wished for an answer to this question, you would''ve been forced to
        base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you
        could''ve based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations
        with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past
        decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have
        a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nThis
        course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School
        of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas
        at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka \"Dr. Happy-smarts\") draws
        content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and
        behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading
        a life of happiness and fulfillment. \n\nAlthough not mandatory, reading Prof.
        Raj''s forthcoming book, titled If you''re so smart, why aren''t you happy?
        (and about which you can find out more at http://deepredink.com/demos/happysmarts/books.php)
        can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your
        leisure. \n\nThe course will feature guest appearances by several well-known
        thought leaders, including:\n      - Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational
        and, soon to be released, Irrationally Yours),\n      - Ed Diener (“Dr. Happiness”),\n      -
        Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (author of Flow),\n\nBy taking this course, you will
        discover the answers to questions such as:\n      - Why aren’t the smart-and-the-successful
        as happy as they could—or should—be\n      - What are the “7 Deadly Happiness
        Sins” that even the smart and the successful commit?, and\n      - What are
        the “7 Habits of the Highly Happy” and how can you implement them in your
        life?\n\nBy the end of the course, I expect students who have been diligent
        with the lectures and exercises to not just gain a deeper understanding of
        the science of happiness, but to also be significantly happier.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"psychology","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["215"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/51/441350c22211e4bd49df699111f70c/Wanting-to-be-happy.JPG","name":"A

        trials are experiments designed to evaluate new interventions to prevent or

        delivery systems (e.g., special care units for hospital admissions). We consider

        We''ll create pieces that are expressive, meditative, or ''design-y'' to instigate,

        are experimental and exploratory; we won’t be concerned with meaning or communication

        communicates—or can convey—meaning, connotation, associations, and expressiveness).

        carry meaning and communication through relational moves like juxtaposition,
        composition, and context. Everyone has a natural, intuitive way of putting
        things together. We’ll look at developing and expanding the range of approaches
        for putting things together, composing page spreads with your images. Since
        nothing exists without context, we look at how to intentionally drive the
        image’s connotations, meanings and associations generated through elements
        of composition and “visual contrasts.” through style, juxtaposition, closure

        of cities to analyse and compare contemporary developments.\n\nGeneral Overview
        Help Center\n\nUrbanization is reaching a new peak in the contemporary world
        with the rise of mega cities. Researchers try to make sense of these large
        urban areas using a variety of concepts. The class will review debates and
        present social science models of cities to analyse and compare contemporary
        developments.\nGlobalization, Europeanization processes support the rapid
        developments of cities in different part of the world. Urbanization is reaching
        a new high in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities (beyond
        15 million inhabitants) such as Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Cairo, Tokyo,
        New York, Shanghai, Mexico or Seoul. Beyond the modern metropolis, researchers
        try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts such
        as the ‘postmetropolis’, ‘global cities’, and ‘global city-regions’. The class
        will review debates and present social science models of cities and metropolis
        to analyse and compare contemporary developments. How can do we study those
        cities when they become mega urban regions, does size matter and for what?
        Do we see the making of a vast urban world or by contrast beyond the apparent
        convergence of complex globalisation processes understood in relation to globalised
        capitalism, is it possible to identify masked differentiations and the strengthening
        of different urban worlds? How do we make sense of this urban world when cities
        are not independent units but have to be understood both in terms of territories,
        rootedness, and at the same time in terms of relations to take into account
        flux, mobility, circulations ? What is the relevance of social science concepts
        developed in the Western world to analyse the transformation of Lagos? To
        what extent may the systematic development of new forms of comparison between
        northern cities and cities from the South change social sciences and contribute
        to overcome the bias towards national comparison? \nFor the time being, given
        current conditions of capitalism, political, economic, cultural and social
        questions are increasingly becoming urban questions. In the modern conception
        of the world/globalcity, characterised by size, the aggregation of housing,
        differentiated divisions of labour, and the density of interaction, several
        conceptions of cities exist which have become entangled and sometimes opposed
        to each other. These different conceptions underline different processes of
        integration: the material city of walls, squares, houses, roads, light, utilities,
        buildings, waste, and physical infrastructure; the cultural city in terms
        of imaginations, differences, representations, ideas, symbols, arts, texts,
        senses, religion, and aesthetics; the politics and policies of the city in
        terms of domination, power, government, mobilisation, public policies, welfare,
        education; the social city of riots, ethnic, economic and gender inequalities,
        everyday life and social movements; and the economy of the city : the division
        of labour, scale, production, consumption, trade.....\nClassic urban questions
        about inequalities, housing, government, integration, are combined with issues
        about the urban fabric, questions of mobility and rootedness, sustainable
        development and risks, the making of the cyborg cities, questions of social
        control and riots, urban culture, innovation and urban economic development.\n\nAll

        course examines macroeconomic performance in the short run and the long run
        based on the economy’s institutional and policy environment. The first module
        develops a model of macroeconomy in the short run when the price level has
        its own momentum and does not respond much to supply and demand forces. The
        model enables one to see how GDP, interest rate, and exchange rate are determined
        in the short run and how they respond to macroeconomic shocks and policies.\n\nThe
        second module starts the analysis of long-run equilibrium by examining the
        foreign exchange market. It then connects the long-run outcome with expectations
        about the future trends in the exchange rate at each moment, which constitute
        a key driver of the spot exchange rate in the short run. The methodology developed
        for this purpose can be applied to expectations concerning other macroeconomic
        variables as well. Finally, the long-run foreign exchange model is employed
        to derive a number of important lessons for the long run trends in currency
        values and competitiveness of producers in various countries.\n\nThe third
        module examines the drivers of aggregate output in the long run and the mechanisms
        of adjustment from the short run to the long run. The model provides insights
        about why some countries are much richer than others and why some economies
        grow faster than others over decades. The analysis also sheds light on why
        inflation varies across countries or over time in the same country. The model
        is employed to analyze the sources of macroeconomic instability and the roles
        of fiscal and monetary policies in stabilization or destabilization of the
        macroeconomy.\n\nThe final module discusses the characteristics of desirable
        macroeconomic policies and the reasons why actual policies deviate from them.
        It connects these deviations to country characteristics that one needs to
        take into account when assessing a country’s long-term macroeconomic environment.
        The module ends with a discussion of the institutional conditions that help
        bring about better fiscal and monetary policies.\n\nAt the end of this course,
        you will be able to:\n•\tUnderstand how the market for aggregate goods and
        services interacts with the money market to shape the macroeconomic equilibrium
        that determines income, interest rate, and exchange rate in the short run.\n•\tUnderstand
        the links between the short-run and long-run processes.\n•\tAssess the dynamic
        effects of macroeconomic policies and understand the roles of globalization,
        government policies, institutions, and expectations in macroeconomic outcomes.\n\nThis

        pick one, download that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But
        suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you''re on 3G. Video quality
        starts to degrade, but you don''t know if it''s the server getting crowded
        or the Internet is congested somewhere. In any case, it costs you $10 per

        between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype, while songs stream
        from iCloud to your phone. You''re happy with the call quality, but get a
        little irritated when you see there''re no new followers on Twitter. You may
        wonder how they all kind of work, and why sometimes they don''t. Take a look

        Again: How to Reason and Argue\nReasoning is important. This series of four
        short courses will teach you how to do it well. You will learn simple but
        vital rules to follow in thinking about any topic at all and common and tempting
        mistakes to avoid in reasoning. We will discuss how to identify, analyze,
        and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians, used car salesmen,
        and teachers) and how to construct arguments of your own in order to help
        you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will be useful in dealing
        with whatever matters most to you.\n\nCourses at a Glance:\nAll four courses
        in this series are offered through sessions which run every four weeks. We
        suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability. If for
        whatever reason you fall behind, feel free to re-enroll in the next session.We
        also suggest that you start each course close to the beginning of a month
        in order to increase the number of peers in the discussion forums who are
        working on the same material as you are. While each course can be taken independently,
        we suggest you take the four courses in order.\n\nCourse 1 - Think Again I:
        How to Understand Arguments\nCourse 2 - Think Again II: How to Reason Deductively\nCourse
        3 - Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively\nCourse 4 - Think Again IV:
        How to Avoid Fallacies\n\nAbout This Course in the Series:\nImagine that a
        friend denies that modus ponens is a valid form of argument. Can you prove
        that it is valid without using modus ponens itself and thereby assuming that
        it is valid? If so, how? If not, what does this show about the validity of
        modus ponens?\n\nHow can phrases like \"and\", \"or\", \"if\", and \"not\"
        work as \"truth-functional connectives\"?\n\nIn this course, you will learn
        how to evaluate deductive arguments for validity. In particular, you will
        learn new ways of representing the information that is contained in the premises
        of a deductive argument. Using these new representational devices (devices
        that we call \"truth tables\" and \"Venn diagrams\"), we will be able to apply
        rules to determine whether or not a particular deductive argument is valid.
        \n\nSuggested Readings:\nStudents who want more detailed explanations or additional
        exercises or who want to explore these topics in more depth should consult
        Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal Logic, Ninth Edition,
        Concise, Chapters 6 and 7 by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin.\n\nCourse
        Format:\nEach week will be divided into multiple video segments that can be
        viewed separately or in groups. There will be short ungraded quizzes after
        each segment (to check comprehension) and a longer graded quiz at the end
        of the course.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"},{"subdomainId":"philosophy","domainId":"arts-and-humanities"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera.s3.amazonaws.com/topics/thinkagain/large-icon.png","id":"aPM0Nx7iEea8agoSdQeRvQ","slug":"deductive-reasoning","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["7"],"name":"Think

        Неймана – ЭВМ привели к появлению многопроцессорных вычислительных систем
        (МВС) или суперкомпьютеров. \nШирокое распространение параллельные вычисления
        приобрели с переходом компьютерной индустрии на массовый выпуск многоядерных
        процессоров с векторными расширениями. В настоящие время практически все устройства
        – от карманных гаджетов и до самых мощных суперкомпьютеров – оснащены многоядерными
        процессорами. И если вы пишите последовательную программу, не применив распределение
        работы между разными ядрами центрального процессора и не проведя векторизацию,
        то вы используете только часть вычислительных возможностей центрального процессора.
        \n\nПройдя этот курс, вы познакомитесь с основными архитектурами МВС, с двумя
        стандартами (OpenMP и MPI), позволяющими писать параллельные программы для
        систем с общей и распределенной памятью. На простых примерах будут разобраны
        основные конструкции и способы распределения работы. Выполнение практических
        заданий позволит вам приобрести практические навыки создания параллельных

        участия в курсе слушателю необходимо иметь базовые знания по программированию
        с использованием С/С++. \n\nКурс состоит из 9 недель. Каждая неделя курса
        содержит видеолекции, а также проверочные задания. Сертификат получают слушатели,
        набравшие более 80 % от максимально возможного количества баллов. При этом
        итоговый результат, представленный как 100 %, складывается из следующих составляющих:
        тесты 1–5 недели дают 4 %, тесты 6–9 недели дают 5 %, все практические задания

        be answered by science, what we can study are the causes and consequences
        of various beliefs about the soul and its prospects of surviving the death
        of the body. Why are soul and afterlife beliefs so common in human history?
        Are there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures

        of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many religions? How

        and videos, and how to apply them in solving practical problems of commercial
        and scientific interests.\n\nDigital images and videos are everywhere these
        days – in thousands of scientific (e.g., astronomical, bio-medical), consumer,
        industrial, and artistic applications. Moreover they come in a wide range
        of the electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma
        rays and beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore
        an incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students,
        software developers, and practicing scientists.   Digital image and video
        processing continues to enable the multimedia technology revolution we are
        experiencing today. Some important examples of image and video processing
        include the removal of degradations images suffer during acquisition (e.g.,
        removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car), and the compression and
        transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos online, or share photos
        via a social media website, you use this everyday!), for economical storage
        and efficient transmission. \n\nThis course will cover the fundamentals of
        image and video processing.  We will provide a mathematical framework to describe
        and analyze images and videos as two- and three-dimensional signals in the
        spatial, spatio-temporal, and frequency domains. In this class not only will
        you learn the theory behind fundamental processing tasks including image/video
        enhancement, recovery, and compression - but you will also learn how to perform
        these key processing tasks in practice using state-of-the-art techniques and
        tools. We will introduce and use a wide variety of such tools – from optimization
        toolboxes to statistical techniques. Emphasis on the special role sparsity
        plays in modern image and video processing will also be given.  In all cases,
        example images and videos pertaining to specific application domains will
        be utilized.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"electrical-engineering"},{"subdomainId":"algorithms","domainId":"computer-science"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3e/8166be0abcc2a8803d91b7aa55135c/logo_aggelos.jpg","id":"d0bq5PkAEeSBSSIAC7JSBQ","slug":"digital","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["54"],"name":"Fundamentals

        This course introduces you to linguistics, featuring interviews with well-known
        linguists and with speakers of many different languages. Join us to explore
        the miracles of human language!\n\nThe Miracles of Human Language introduces
        you to the many-faceted study of languages, which has amazed humans since
        the beginning of history. Together with speakers of many other languages around
        the world, as well as with famous linguists such as Noam Chomsky and Adele
        Goldberg, you will learn to understand and analyse how your native tongue
        is at the same time similar and different from many other languages. You will
        learn the basic concepts of linguistics, get to know some of the key features
        of big and small languages and get insight into what linguists do.\n\nThis
        course gives an introduction into the study of languages, the field of linguistics.
        With the support of the basic linguistic terminology that is offered in the
        course, you will soon be able to comment both on variety between languages,
        as well as on a single language’s internal structure. Anyone who wishes to
        understand how languages work, and how they can give us insight into the human
        mind is very welcome to join.\n\nThe course is useful if you want to get a
        fairly quick introduction into linguistics, for instance because you are considering
        studying it further, or because you are interested in a neighbouring discipline
        such as psychology, computer science or anthropology. Furthermore, the course
        will help you develop analytical skills.\n\nIf you are curious to understand
        how language works and how it gives insight into the human mind, this course

        Diaspora in China is a unique experience for world Jewry, as China is the

        1,000 years. Documentary evidence shows that Jews started to live in China
        no later than the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The famous Kaifeng Jewish community,
        which was established in Kaifeng, the Chinese capital of the Song Dynasty
        (960-1279), is but a best-known example. However, the largest Jewish Diaspora
        in China appeared in modern times. In over 100 years, from the mid-19th century
        to the mid-20th century, about 40,000 Jews came to China and lived in newly-established
        major port cities such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Harbin. Jewish
        communities composed of these Jews became an essential part of the economic
        and social life of those modern Chinese cities. What brought such a large
        number of Jews to China? Where did these people come from? How did they arrive?
        Were they all in China at the same time, and were there any differences among
        them? What happened to them after they arrived? Where are they now? The story

        course provides an introduction to systems thinking and systems models in
        public health. Problems in public health and health policy tend to be complex
        with many actors, institutions and risk factors involved. If an outcome depends
        on many interacting and adaptive parts and actors the outcome cannot be analyzed
        or predicted with traditional statistical methods. Systems  thinking is a
        core skill in public health and helps health policymakers build programs and
        policies that are aware of and prepared for unintended consequences.\n\nAn
        important part of systems thinking is the practice to integrate multiple perspectives
        and synthesize them into a framework or model that can describe and predict
        the various ways in which a system might react to policy change. Systems thinking
        and systems models devise strategies to account for real world complexities.\n\n\nThis
        work was coordinated by the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research,
        the World Health Organization, with the aid of a grant from the International
        Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada. Additional support was provided

        is the purpose of government?  Why should we have a State?  What kind of State
        should we have?\n\nEven within a political community, there may be sharp disagreements
        about the role and purpose of government.  Some want an active, involved government,
        seeing legal and political institutions as the means to solve our most pressing
        problems, and to help bring about peace, equality, justice, happiness, and
        to protect individual liberty.  Others want a more minimal government, motivated,
        perhaps, by some of the disastrous political experiments of the 20th Century,
        and the thought that political power is often just a step away from tyranny.  In
        many cases, these disagreements arise out of deep philosophical disagreements.
        \n\nAll political and legal institutions are built on foundational ideas.  In
        this course, we will explore those ideas, taking the political institutions
        and political systems around us not as fixed and unquestionable, but as things
        to evaluate and, if necessary, to change.  We will consider the ideas and
        arguments of some of the world’s most celebrated philosophers, including historical
        thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Immanuel Kant,
        Mary Wollstonecraft, and John Stuart Mill; and more contemporary theorists
        such as Elizabeth Anderson, Isaiah Berlin, Thomas Christiano, Frantz Fanon,
        Amy Gutmann, Friedrich Hayek, Robert Nozick, Martha Nussbaum, Julius Nyerere,
        Ayn Rand, John Rawls, Peter Singer, and Kok-Chor Tan. \n\nThe aim of the course
        is not to convince you of the correctness of any particular view or political
        position, but to provide you with a deeper and more philosophically-informed
        basis for your own views, and, perhaps, to help you better understand the
        views of those with whom you disagree.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["6"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/6f/bce030b8d911e38725b565d9244244/Screen-Shot-2014-03-31-at-2.12.03-PM.png","name":"Revolutionary

        Course FOUR!   In Modules 1-4 you will cover the final elements of the Specialization
        necessary to round out this introduction to the fundamentals of Photography,
        and prepare you for creating your own exciting project in the Capstone!  You
        have come a long way since the beginning of this journey from Smartphone Basics
        to DSLR and Beyond.  Just think of all the information you have absorbed and
        put to use in your assignments and quizzes, and the confidence you have gained
        that you CAN control the camera to make pictures you are proud to share.  \n\nHere
        in Course Four you will start by gaining knowledge related to content in photography,
        from fact to fiction, documentary to purely expressive.  Next you will learn
        principles, tips, and techniques for using the essential element of Light
        in Ambient/Natural settings.  \n\nThe flash/strobe unit, whether it is built-in
        to your camera or an add-on \"hotshoe\" model, will finally be something you,
        not the camera, controls!  You will prove to yourself that those former mysteries
        of Controlled Continuous and Strobe lighting will no longer be mysterious,
        as you apply your knowledge to creation of assignment photographs in various
        situations.  Sharing those pictures in Peer Review will give you the opportunity
        to learn from your fellow photographers'' solutions to lighting challenges,
        and to gain insight into your own work and creative approaches too.  \n\nThere
        is an important word to share about Peer Review assignments for this course.  As
        photographers who have accomplished the quiz and photography requirements
        of Courses One through Three, you have the knowledge and capability to create
        quality photographs at a much higher rate of success, and in a much shorter
        time, than when you began.  You have also proven that you are a dedicated
        Learner, someone who has a passion for photography and is willing to put forth
        the extra effort necessary to accomplish your goals.  This Course is the last
        before the Capstone Course, in which you will be tasked with creating a project
        over a 2-month period of dedicated photography.  The Peer Review photography
        assignments have been structured with both your advanced capabilities and
        dedication in mind...in other words, they will require both!  Be prepared
        to allocate more time than you have in previous Courses for the assignments,
        because they will take more time and because you will really enjoy them!\n\nCourse
        Four ends with an overview of methods for finalizing your pictures in print
        form, including simple but effective matting techniques, and in web page designs
        as well.  The pleasures and perils of sharing in social media sites are also
        yours to discover.  Protecting your copyrights by understanding that concept
        and the ways that you can assert them, being careful about blogs and other
        outlets, and recognizing you are part of a community that respects the individual''s
        creative effort, well that is  important knowledge to have in preparation

        tonalities and the characteristics of voiced (tonal) speech. Like the phenomenology

        is often claimed that relativism, subjectivism and nihilism are typically

        lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread
        in modernity. \n\nThe Danish thinker Søren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one
        of the most penetrating analyses of this complex phenomenon of modernity.

        live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose
        behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political
        uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How
        do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with
        models consistently outperform those who don''t. And, moreover people who
        think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models
        make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to
        make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available
        on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts.
        They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They
        even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this
        class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points.
        I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why
        some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the
        strategic decisions of firm and politicians. \n\nThe models covered in this
        class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they
        be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this
        material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you
        in life. Here''s how the course will work. For each model, I present a short,
        easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I''ll dig deeper. I''ll go into
        the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won''t require
        calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I''ll offer
        some questions and we''ll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide
        to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you''ll receive
        a Course Certificate. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory
        lectures to gain some exposure that''s fine too. It''s all free. And it''s

        Neuroscience explores the functional organization and neurophysiology of the
        human central nervous system, while providing a neurobiological framework
        for understanding human behavior. In this course, you will discover the organization
        of the neural systems in the brain and spinal cord that mediate sensation,
        motivate bodily action, and integrate sensorimotor signals with memory, emotion
        and related faculties of cognition. The overall goal of this course is to
        provide the foundation for understanding the impairments of sensation, action
        and cognition that accompany injury, disease or dysfunction in the central
        nervous system. The course will build upon knowledge acquired through prior
        studies of cell and molecular biology, general physiology and human anatomy,
        as we focus primarily on the central nervous system.\n\nThis online course
        is designed to include all of the core concepts in neurophysiology and clinical
        neuroanatomy that would be presented in most first-year neuroscience courses
        in schools of medicine. However, there are some topics (e.g., biological psychiatry)
        and several learning experiences (e.g., hands-on brain dissection) that we
        provide in the corresponding course offered in the Duke University School
        of Medicine on campus that we are not attempting to reproduce in Medical Neuroscience
        online. Nevertheless, our aim is to faithfully present in scope and rigor
        a medical school caliber course experience.\n\nThis course comprises six units
        of content organized into 12 weeks, with an additional week for a comprehensive
        final exam:\n- Unit 1 Neuroanatomy (weeks 1-2). This unit covers the surface
        anatomy of the human brain, its internal structure, and the overall organization
        of sensory and motor systems in the brainstem and spinal cord.\n- Unit 2 Neural
        signaling (weeks 3-4). This unit addresses the fundamental mechanisms of neuronal
        excitability, signal generation and propagation, synaptic transmission, post
        synaptic mechanisms of signal integration, and neural plasticity.\n- Unit
        3 Sensory systems (weeks 5-7). Here, you will learn the overall organization
        and function of the sensory systems that contribute to our sense of self relative
        to the world around us: somatic sensory systems, proprioception, vision, audition,
        and balance senses.\n- Unit 4 Motor systems (weeks 8-9). In this unit, we
        will examine the organization and function of the brain and spinal mechanisms
        that govern bodily movement.\n- Unit 5 Brain Development (week 10). Next,
        we turn our attention to the neurobiological mechanisms for building the nervous
        system in embryonic development and in early postnatal life; we will also
        consider how the brain changes across the lifespan.\n- Unit 6 Cognition (weeks
        11-12). The course concludes with a survey of the association systems of the
        cerebral hemispheres, with an emphasis on cortical networks that integrate
        perception, memory and emotion in organizing behavior and planning for the
        future; we will also consider brain systems for maintaining homeostasis and
        regulating brain state.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"medicine-and-healthcare","domainId":"life-sciences"},{"subdomainId":"biology","domainId":"life-sciences"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera.s3.amazonaws.com/topics/medicalneuro/large-icon.png","id":"Nyq7nXzPEeWb-BLhFdaGww","slug":"medical-neuroscience","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["7"],"name":"Medical

        לסוגיו הוא התשתית שעליה מבוססים החיים המודרניים. כבר יותר ממאה שנה אנו משתמשים
        בדלקים מאובנים שנאצרו בבטן האדמה – נפט, גז טבעי ופחם – כדי להניע את גלגלי
        עולמנו: תעשייה מתקדמת, תחבורה מהירה, בתים נוחים ועוד. בקורס זה ננסה לבחון
        אלטרנטיבות אפשריות לדלקים המאובנים, הגורמים נזק לא מבוטל לסביבתנו ולבריאותנו.
        נתאר את המחקר המדעי האינטנסיבי המתקיים בתחום, ונציג מגוון טכנולוגיות מתקדמות
        להפקת אנרגיה נקייה ממקורות טבעיים ומתחדשים – כמו השמש, הרוח והמים – מקורות
        המצויים בשפע, אינם מזהמים, ואינם מתכלים.\n\nקורס המבוא לאנרגיה מתחדשת ייפתח
        בשאלות הבסיס של תחום האנרגיה: מהם צורכי האנרגיה של האנושות כיום, ואילו משאבים
        עומדים לרשותה? אילו תהליכים אנו מכירים  לאיסוף, המרה וניצול של מקורות אנרגיה?
        מהן הבעיות שנוצרות עקב השימוש הנוכחי במקורות אנרגיה מאובנים? ואיזה שינוי נדרש
        במדיניות האנרגיה ובמשק האנרגיה של החברה המודרנית?\n\nמכאן נעבור לתיאור הסוגים
        העיקריים של אנרגיה מתחדשת – מקורות אנרגיה טבעיים, זמינים ובלתי מתכלים, שאינם
        גורמים נזק סביבתי, ועשויים להחליף את הדלקים המאובנים. נדבר על אנרגיית השמש,
        אנרגיית הרוח, אנרגיית המים וביו-אנרגיה; ננתח את הטכנולוגיות הקיימות כבר היום
        לניצול המקורות הללו לצורכי האדם; נציג כלים בסיסיים לחישוב יעילות ההמרה של
        כל טכנולוגיה, וכמויות האנרגיה שניתן להפיק באמצעותה; ונביא דרכים להערכת הכדאיות
        הכלכלית של כל אחת מהשיטות.\n\nבמקביל, נדון בקשיים ובאתגרים הממתינים עדיין
        לפתרון, ונשאל מה יש לעשות כדי שהאנרגיות המתחדשות ייושמו בקנה מידה רחב – בתעשייה,
        בתחבורה, ובכל תחומי חיינו. נבחן מגוון טכנולוגיות מתקדמות להפקת אנרגיה ממקורות
        נקיים; נסביר מדוע הן עדיין אינן תופסות את מקומם של הדלקים המאובנים; ונציג
        כיווני מחקר עכשוויים ופיתוחים חדשניים שמשפרים ומייעלים לא הרף את השיטות הקיימות,
        במטרה להבטיח לכולנו עתיד בר-קיימא.\n\n \n\nCourse language is Hebrew! English
        subtitles are planned but not yet available.\n\nFuels are the foundations
        of modern living. For over a century we have been drawing fossil fuels – oil,
        coal and natural gas – from the depths of the earth, and using them to power
        our world: advanced industries, fast transportation, comfortable homes and
        more. In this course we will examine possible alternatives for these fuels
        - which have proved quite damaging to both our health and our environment.
        We will describe the intensive worldwide efforts in this field of research,
        and present their encouraging outcome: a range of innovative technologies
        for generating clean energy from natural, non-polluting and renewable sources
        – such as sunlight, wind and water.\n\nThe course will open with some fundamental
        questions on energy: What are the energy needs of the global population today,
        and what will they be tomorrow? What are the resources at our disposal? What
        are the known processes for harvesting, converting and utilizing resources
        of energy? What are the problems generated by the use of fossil fuels? In
        what ways must we change our energy policies and energy economy? And most
        important of all: What are the alternatives to fossil fuels, and can they
        supply humanity''s extensive and constantly growing energy needs?\n\nSubsequent
        lessons will introduce the main types of safe, clean, natural and renewable
        energy sources available to us: solar energy, wind energy, water energy and
        bioenergy. We will speak of existing technologies that already harness these
        resources to the needs of humankind, and supply simple tools for computing
        conversion efficiencies, calculating the amounts of energy produced through
        the various methods, and assessing their economic feasibility.\n\nIn parallel,
        we will discuss the remaining problems and challenges, and ask what must be
        done to enable the large-scale use of renewable energy – in industry, in transportation,
        and in every other sphere of our lives. We will examine several advanced renewable
        energy technologies; explain why they have not yet taken the place of fossil
        fuels; and present cutting-edge innovations and promising research directions
        – in the ongoing global effort to ensure a sustainable future for us all.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"environmental-science-and-sustainability"}],"primaryLanguages":["he"],"partnerIds":["110"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/28/9dbde0aedd11e592f52d1e33da9f3c/introduction-to-renewable-energy.jpg","name":"מבוא

        to the capstone project course in the Coursera Inspirational Leadership Specialization!
        \nIn the next 6 weeks you''ll apply the skills you learned in the Specialization
        to tackle a real world leadership challenge. \nTo better meet your own goals
        of taking this Specialization, we provide two options for the capstone project:
        \n1) Personal leadership challenge; \n2) Cooperate leadership challenges.
        \nYou''ll select one project to implement and will receive assessments from
        your Capstone peers. No matter which option you choose, the capstone project
        will examine your skills, including self-awareness, developing quality relationships
        and trust, resilience, and how making decisions entails a strong sense of
        responsibility.\n\nFor the corporate challenge, the CEO will introduce it
        as:\n“In this capstone, you will have to analyze a situation our company is
        experiencing today and prepare recommendations to our executive committee
        explaining how to implement the best possible solution to our leadership challenge.”  \n\nThe
        challenge to be addressed will touch upon the capacity for an organization
        to grow while keeping its sense of purpose. WIth Poilâne, the original sense
        of the company is anchored in the values of making the same quality bread
        for all. When increasing in size and outreach, how can Apollonia and her team
        maintain the same strong values across places and people? With Bla Bla Car,
        the fast pace growth of the company raises the same questions around identity.
        You will find more details as the Capstone unfolds.\nYou can also choose to
        work on your own organization challenge.\n\nFor the personal challenge, you
        will work on your own question addressing your capacity to grow as a leader.
        A challenge can be a target objective (starting a company, running a project,
        designing a product, winning a competition, running a marathon…) you have
        for yourself which puts into question what you want to achieve and how. The
        Capstone will help you measure the challenge, establish a process and build
        the steps to meet your goals.\n\nWhether you choose the corporate challenge
        or corporate challenge, specific questions will attest to your capacity to
        analyze and criticize the the problem which is faced by the company or by
        yourself, the capacity for the stakeholders to address the issues. You will
        make recommendations as if you were at the head of the company or the problem.\n\nThe
        process that will drive the Business plan will follow step by step the relational
        circuit model developed in MOOC2 “Giving Sense to your Leadership Experience”
        and MOOC3 “Leading Organizations” with its two phases of Exploration and Projection.\n\nIn
        the EXPLORATION, you will engage in a first step of holistic perception of
        the problem using your sensible skills to give a sense of perspective and
        give voice to you subjective apprehension of the situation as a whole. The
        second stage of exploration will involve your analytical skills to understand
        each and every component (elements of data relevant to the challenge) that
        plays a role in defining the situation. And the third stage of exploration
        will apply your relational skills where you will make sense and connect your
        subjective perception with your analysis. You will share the exploration results
        with peers to receive feedback before your can move on.\n\nThe second phase,
        the PROJECTION part of your business plan leading to recommendations for the
        company or personal challenge at stake. In the projection phase you will first
        look at what the situation might be when you decenter the problem in time
        and space. Using benchmark and competitive analysis, you will work on different
        scenarios for the projected outcomes. Finally, with a view to build sense
        out of the challenge you will come up with recommendations arguing for a preferred
        scenario that respects the values and principles of the organization after
        the change.\nYou will prepare a 10’ presentation for your recommendations
        to be delivered to the CEO of the company or owner of the challenge.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5c/33c8f044c211e594e0993d66d95520/Vignette-CAPSTONE_student.jpg","id":"sNx-mzaXEeWa2g6sjqf03Q","slug":"leadership-challenge","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["161"],"name":"CAPSTONE:

        the way it structures itself and runs its decision making meetings? \n\nWeek
        2: This week''s questions:  What do we mean by board composition and development
        and why is it important? Why is it difficult to change the composition of
        the board? How do you design the ideal mix of board members? How do you locate,
        recruit and develop board members?   \n\nWeek 3: This week''s questions: What
        do we mean by the \"culture\" of the board and why is it important? How do
        boards develop and pass along culture? Can board cultures be intentionally
        changed? What is the role of leadership in shaping board culture? What do
        effective nonprofit leaders involved in governance do?  How can leadership
        be managed for higher performance?\n\nWeek 4: At this stage, you are asked
        to review the course content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly

        for the history of the Roman Empire, of Judaism, of Christianity and of modern
        nationalism.  \n\nTogether with your guide, Professor Steven Fine, you will
        examine ancient texts and artifacts, gaining skills as a historian as you
        explore the continuing significance of the Arch of Titus from antiquity to
        the very present.   Course members will accompany Professor Fine on virtual
        \"fieldtrips\" to museums and historical sites in Los Angeles and New York

        Inquiry is a collaborative and constructive inquiry process that searches
        for everything that gives life to organizations, communities, and larger human
        systems when they are most alive, effective, creative and healthy in their
        interconnected ecology of relationships. To appreciate, quite simply, means
        to value and to recognize that which has value—it is a way of knowing and
        valuing the best in life. In the language of Positive Organizational Scholarship
        it means a research focus—a positive bias—seeking fresh understanding of dynamics
        described by words like excellence, thriving, abundance, resilience, or exceptional
        and life-giving. \n\nIn this context the word appreciate means to value those
        things of value—it is a mode of knowing often connected to the idea of esthetic
        appreciation in the arts. To appreciate also means to be grateful or thankful
        for—it is a way of being and maintaining a positive stance along the path
        of life''s journey. And not incidentally, to appreciate is to increase in
        value too. Combining the three—appreciation as a way of knowing, as a way
        of being and as an increase in value– suggests that Appreciative Inquiry is
        simultaneously a life-centric form of study and a constructive mode of practice.  As
        a form of study, Appreciative Inquiry focuses on searching systematically
        for those capacities and processes that give life and strength and possibility
        to a living system; and as a constructive mode of practice, it aims at designing
        and crafting human organizations through a process in which valuing and creating
        are viewed as one, and where inquiry and change are powerfully related and
        understood as a seamless and integral whole \n\nLeading Positive Change through
        Appreciative Inquiry is a course dedicated to advancing our understanding
        and skill in leading strength-based change and on how to create, foster and

        Your Leadership Skills” and “Giving Sense to your Leadership Experience” prior
        of taking this course.\n\nIn this course you’ll get the opportunity to apply
        the skills learned in the first two courses of the “Inspirational Leadership:
        Leading with Sense” as an individual to a group setting. The group could not
        only be an organization such as a company or a team in a company, but also
        a private group such as your family or an association. \n\nSpecifically, you’ll
        apply the 4 steps of The Savoir-Relier protocol to your group: \n1. defining
        the group identity by working on the group self-awareness, \n2. creating quality
        relationships within the group, \n3. working on resilience for the group to
        then be able to overcome difficult situation and \n4. Making the organization
        grow by creating sense and meaning.\n\nSo if you want your group to grow as
        a successful leader in its fields, if you want to find your identity as a
        group and create shared values for it, or if you want your group to become
        more resilient in face of change and crisis, this course is made for you!
        Finally, at the end of the course, you would have build sense for your group
        in order to be more efficient.\n\nUsing real-life cases you will see how the
        genuine, generous and generative characteristics apply to the development
        of successful organizations. For example, you will apply the Relational Circuit
        to recruit effectively, or the Self-Portrait and Conversation exercises to
        create team cohesion and resilience to overcome crises and interpersonal conflicts.
        You will be able to form trustworthy relationships in spite of diverging or
        different views, and you will grow respect in your environment where sense
        will be a driver for you and your surrounding.\n\nLeaders from different organizations,
        will share with you their insights about how they have applied the Savoir-Relier
        approach to their company and how it has made the company more resilience

        Jim Barton, the new CEO of Santa Monica Aerospace. Jim''s job won''t be easy:
        the company''s hemorrhaging cash, struggling to regain investors'' trust after
        an accounting scandal, and striving to transform its culture to become a more
        global competitor. In this course, you’ll travel with Jim as he takes on leadership
        challenges ranging from strategy execution, to inspiring people, to maintaining
        an ethical approach. Experts agree that twentieth-century leadership practices
        are inadequate for the stormy twenty-first-century present. This provocative
        course equips you with the insights you''ll need to rise with the occasion
        of a rapidly shifting business landscape.\n\nThe course is based on a book,
        Harder Than I Thought: Adventures of a 21st Century Leader, by Robert D. Austin,
        Richard L. Nolan, and Shannon O''Donnell, published by Harvard Business Review
        Press. Purchase of the book is optional. If you want more information about

        in the past, but are not suited to a newly challenging 21st century world;\no   Navigate
        treacherous new 21st century leadership challenges, such as greater reliance
        on specialized workers or the need to respond to external scrutiny in an increasingly
        transparent world (and many more);\no   Avoid \"slippery slope\" ethical failures,

        make thousands of decisions every day. Do I cross the road now, or wait for
        the oncoming truck to pass? Should I eat fries or a salad for lunch? How much
        should I tip the cab driver? We usually make these decisions with almost no
        thought, using what psychologists call “heuristics” – rules of thumb that
        enable us to navigate our lives. Without these mental shortcuts, we would
        be paralyzed by the multitude of daily choices. But in certain circumstances,
        these shortcuts lead to predictable errors – predictable, that is, if we know
        what to watch out for. Did you know, for example, that we are naturally biased
        towards selling investments that are doing well for us, but holding on to
        those that are doing poorly? Or that we often select sub-optimal insurance
        payment plans, and routinely purchase insurance that we don’t even need? And
        why do so many of us fail to enroll in our employer’s corporate retirement
        plans, even when the employer offers to match our contributions?\n\nBehavioral
        finance is the study of these and dozens of other financial decision-making
        errors that can be avoided, if we are familiar with the biases that cause
        them. In this course, we examine these predictable errors, and discover where
        we are most susceptible to them. This course is intended to guide participants
        towards better financial choices. Learn how to improve your spending, saving,
        and investing decisions for the future.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"finance","domainId":"business"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-strategy"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c6/326590235611e6b8c873bbaf299b3b/piggy-bank-1019758_1920.jpg","id":"NSxhuc9cEeWczg7kSY_tVQ","slug":"duke-behavioral-finance","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["7"],"name":"Behavioral

        history, the vast majority of people around the globe have believed they have,
        however defined, a “soul.” While the question of whether the soul exists cannot
        be answered by science, what we can study are the causes and consequences
        of various beliefs about the soul and its prospects of surviving the death
        of the body. Why are soul and afterlife beliefs so common in human history?
        Are there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures
        that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the foundation
        of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many religions? How
        do these beliefs shape the worldviews of different cultures and our collective
        lives? What is the role of competing afterlife beliefs in religion, science,
        politics, and war? This course explores several facets of this relatively
        unexplored but profoundly important aspect of human thought and behavior.\n\nThe
        course consists mainly of 70 to 80 minute lectures, typically broken up into
        3 segments, recorded from a course offered by Rutgers University School of
        Arts and Sciences.  These videos include slides and some embedded video clips.  Most
        lectures are accompanied by slides used during the lecture, also including
        recommended reading assignment which may provide additional opportunities
        to reflect on your studies.\n\nDue to the lengthiness of this class and natural

        note: The second assignment in this course covers the topic of Graph Analysis
        in the Cloud, in which you will use Elastic MapReduce and the Pig language
        to perform graph analysis over a moderately large dataset, about 600GB. In
        order to complete this assignment, you will need to make use of Amazon Web
        Services (AWS). Amazon has generously offered to provide up to $50 in free
        AWS credit to each learner in this course to allow you to complete the assignment.
        Further details regarding the process of receiving this credit are available
        in the welcome message for the course, as well as in the assignment itself.

        cours expose la théorie de Galois, du classique critère de non-résolubilité
        des équations polynomiales aux méthodes plus avancées de calcul de groupes
        de Galois par réduction modulo un nombre premier.\\n\\nLe thème général de
        cette théorie est l'étude des racines d'un polynôme et concerne en particulier
        la possibilité de les exprimer à partir des coefficients de ce polynôme. Evariste
        Galois considère les symétries de ces racines et associe ainsi à ce polynôme
        un groupe de permutations de ses racines, que l'on appelle maintenant son
        groupe de Galois. Il dégage à cette occasion pour la première fois, dans ce
        cadre, la notion de groupe, maintenant omniprésente en mathématiques. Son
        étude lui permet d'expliquer pourquoi les racines d'une équation prise au
        hasard ne s'expriment en général pas par des formules algébriques faisant
        intervenir ses coefficients à partir du degré 5, un résultat démontré auparavant
        par Abel. Plus généralement, l'étude du groupe de Galois du polynôme permet
        de dire exactement quand une telle formule existe. C'est ce que l'on appelle
        la correspondance de Galois : elle relie d'une part la théorie des corps,
        d'autre part la théorie des groupes.Ce cours expliquera cette théorie en n'utilisant
        que des résultats de base d'algèbre linéaire. Nous étudierons d'un côté la
        théorie des corps, c'est-à-dire la façon dont les corps s'emboîtent les uns
        dans les autres, en introduisant la notion de nombre algébrique (essentiellement
        les racines de polynômes). D'un autre côté, nous introduirons les éléments
        nécessaires à l'étude des groupes de permutations. Cela nous permettra d'expliquer
        la théorie de Galois, non seulement dans son cadre d'origine, c'est-à-dire
        quand les coefficients du polynôme sont des nombres entiers, mais aussi dans
        un cadre plus général, par exemple lorsqu'on réduit ces coefficients modulo
        un nombre premier p.\\n\\nLe cours culminera avec une comparaison des groupes
        de Galois dans ces deux situations (« entière » et après réduction modulo
        p), fournissant ainsi un outil de calcul puissant de ces groupes.\\n\\nCe
        cours est l'occasion d'aborder des notions d'algèbre variées, essentielles
        dans de nombreux domaines des mathématiques, de manière très simple pour très
        rapidement aboutir à des résultats tout à fait remarquables. Nous n'avons
        pas cherché la généralité maximale mais au contraire à aller rapidement à
        l'essentiel en utilisant le minimum de formalisme abstrait. Le FLOTeur intéressé

        всем мостам через реку Преголя, не проходя ни по одному из них дважды. Многие
        кёнигсбержцы пытались решить эту задачу как теоретически, так и практически
        во время прогулок. Доказать или опровергнуть возможность существования такого
        маршрута никто не мог до 1736 года, когда выдающийся математик Леонард Эйлер
        не написал письмо своему другу с решением. Ответ был «нельзя». Так и родилась

        put all of that theory and discussion into practice and examine great examples
        of common coaching conversations!\\n\\nNote: This course builds on all previous
        courses in the Coaching Skills for Managers specialization. It is highly recommended
        that students complete or be familiar with the topics covered in those courses
        before taking this course. In particular, you should be familiar with the
        coaching strategies and tools discussed in previous courses (such as the 5
        whys technique, resisting what is, among others), and should have a full understanding
        of the Thought model and the various components of it: circumstances, thoughts,
        feelings, actions, and results.\\n\\nBy the end of this course, you will be
        able to demonstrate appropriate and effective strategies when engaging in
        coaching conversations with those that you lead. By exploring and analyzing
        common coaching scenarios that are acted out in this course, you will have
        a great sense of what works well and not so well during such a conversation.
        Specifically, you'll be able to better differentiate between a developmental
        coaching approach and a directive management style, discuss new strategies
        and techniques for dealing with both mind set and skill set gaps, describe
        how to use the feedback loop effectively in a conversation, and demonstrate
        the use of good questioning techniques and the thought model to not only help
        an employee identify issues, but help the employee really change their thinking.\\n\\nThe
        final assignment is all about actually having a coaching conversation with
        another person where you can apply everything you've learned in this course
        and throughout the Coaching Skills for Managers specialization. Again, it
        is highly recommended students complete the other courses in the specialization
        before taking this one. This peer review assignment, in particular, will be
        difficult to complete without knowledge of the topics covered in these courses.\\n\\nAfter
        going through the course materials and completing the assessments, you will

        is the art of manipulating the visual form of language to enrich and control
        its meaning. It’s an essential area of skill and knowledge for graphic designers.

        in rules, conventions, and esoteric terminology—but it remains an exciting
        space for invention and expression.\\n\\nIn this rigorous introductory course,
        we will study, name, and measure the characteristics of letterforms. We’ll
        consider the pragmatic concerns involved in selecting and combining type.
        We’ll peek into the \Lrich historical, cultural, and aesthetic histories of
        familiar typefaces. We’ll discuss time-tested conventions and best practices
        in setting type, as governed by principles of hierarchy and spatial organization.
        And we’ll explore the expressive, meaning-making potential of type. \\n\\nInformative

        «Читаем русскую классику вместе. М. Булгаков \\\"Мастер и Маргарита\\\"» нацелен
        на овладение в совместной деятельности (преподаватель-студент) универсальной
        поэтапной моделью работы с художественным текстом, которая может быть использована
        как основа для формирования навыков смыслового чтения художественного произведения.
        Подобные навыки значимы как в реальной коммуникации, так и в учебной деятельности
        (на родном и иностранном языке). Произведение М. Булгакова \\\"Мастер и Маргарита\\\",
        выбранное для формирования навыков смыслового чтения, составляет золотой фонд
        мировой художественной культуры.\\n\\nВ этом курсе слушатели научатся:\\n1.
        анализировать художественное произведение с точки зрения коммуникативного
        замысла автора; \\n2. комментировать текст с точки зрения полученного коммуникативного
        задания; \\n3. интепретировать художественный текст, выделяя содержательные
        и языковые единицы, являющиеся основой развития писательской мысли; \\n4.
        прогнозировать содержание текста на основе смыслового анализа; \\n5. конструировать
        собственное высказывание; \\n6. рефлексировать по поводу образов, образных
        средств, коммуникативного замысла писателя; \\n7. оценивать собственное речевое
        произведение, созданное как результат рефлексии по поводу текста.\\n\\nТребования
        к уровню подготовки слушателей: \\n- знание базового курса русской литературы
        в объеме средней школы (для российских участников); \\n- владение русским
        \ языком на уровне А2 – В1 и выше (для иностранных обучающихся), \\n- прочитанный
        роман М.А. Булгакова \\\"Мастер и Маргарита\\\" (для иностранных обучающихся
        возможно прочтение на родном языке). \\n\\nThe ideal outcome from the course
        is to master by means of teacher-student cooperation a universal model of
        work with literary text that may be used as a basis of purposeful reading
        skills formation. These skills are significant in real communication and in
        training activities (both in native and foreign languages). The writing that
        has been selected for purposeful reading skills formation is popular in Russia
        as well asabroad. Moreover it is a part of the world literature gold reserves.
        \\n\\nBy the end of the course learners will be able \\n1) to analyze a writing
        from the point of view of the author’s communicative idea; \\n2) to comment
        on the text considering the provided communicative task; \\n3) to interpret
        a writingdefining meaningful and linguistic units that serve as a basis of
        the writer’s idea development; \\n4) predict the content of the text basing
        on the sentiment analysis; \\n5) to construct their own judgement; \\n6) to
        introspect on the author’s images, means, communicative idea; \\n7) evaluate
        their own speech utterance as a result of the introspection on the text; \\n8)
        to compare the text of the writing considering the objective.\\n\\nNeeded
        Learner Background:\\n- basic knowledge in Russian literature (equivalent
        to the secondary education in Russia), \\n- level of competency in Russian

        its walls razed to ground by Babylon’s armies, Jerusalem joined a long line
        of ancient vanquished cities—from Ur and Nineveh and Persepolis to Babylon
        itself. While some recovered from the destruction, others did not.  But none
        responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and
        enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered
        populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned
        it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past.  The
        biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings
        that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover
        thereby a ground for collective hope.  \n \nWorking through colorful biblical
        and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples,
        the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors
        responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community
        at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and
        they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories
        and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt,
        to humanity’s greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the
        Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that
        could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary
        legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important,
        these authors’ visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new
        wisdom:  the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs
        it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can
        claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part
        in its collective life.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/51/b1c0ccbfc15fb49e3719618b36929f/wright-class.jpg","id":"39iAT2nMEeSqESIAC44MZQ","slug":"bible-history","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["23"],"name":"The

        the basic concepts and approaches needed to understand, create, and perform

        how it works, or if you are a musician who learned to play by ear without
        formal study, this course will provide you with an engaging introduction to
        key concepts and approaches needed to understand, create, and perform contemporary
        music. Taught by Berklee College of Music professor George W. Russell, Jr.,
        the course includes six lessons that delve into harmony and ear training—two
        areas of intensive focus for every entering Berklee student. \n\nThe course
        will teach you the major scale and minor pentatonic scale, and how they are
        constructed. You will learn what intervals are, how to sing them, and how
        to find them in music. The course explores tonal centers and how to find the
        key a song is in, in addition to common time signatures such as 4/4 and 3/4.
        You will learn how to build chords—major and minor triads, and major and dominant
        seventh chords—and how to build a common chord progression—the I IV V. You
        will also learn how to recognize the blues and AABA song forms, and write
        a basic chord sheet to express your song ideas. \n\nIn addition to the video
        lectures, each lesson features Berklee student performances and interviews.
        The students share their musical journey and offer advice for those wanting
        to study music. The course culminates with an assignment that asks you to
        compose and perform a riff blues tune using the minor pentatonic scale. Above
        all, the course is designed to share the joy of creating music and sharing
        it with others.\n\nShannon Jacob will be your Teaching Assistant (TA) for

        project will consist of three options, and you will complete one of them as
        part of the course.\n\nThe first option is working with senior-level executives
        to help them solve their most pressing leadership challenges. Two (2) senior-level
        executives from leading organizations will provide detailed descriptions of
        ongoing leadership challenges that they are currently facing within their
        organizations. The challenges will be real and current. You will be asked
        to help the executives think through how best to approach and address their
        respective leadership challenges. Specifically, you will be tasked with drafting
        a memo to one of the executives outlining your recommendations for how best
        to address the leadership challenge. To offer effective advice and counsel,
        you will need to use course concepts and frameworks to (a) diagnose the fundamental
        issue(s), and then (b) develop a coherent set of solutions or recommendations.
        The memos will be evaluated based on how effectively you apply course concepts
        to diagnose the problem and how well you link your proposed solutions to the
        diagnosis. The best submissions will be sent to the executives for their review,
        and each executive will offer feedback that will then be shared with the entire
        class to advance everyone’s learning.\n\nThe second option is to identify
        your own leadership challenge (e.g., at work, at school, in your local community).
        You should be directly involved in the challenge, and the challenge must align
        with at least one topic from the specialization. You will develop a presentation
        where you use course concepts and frameworks to (a) diagnose the core leadership
        challenge and barriers to effective performance, and then (b) develop a coherent
        set of solutions or recommendations for your own leadership challenge.\n \nThe
        third option asks you to interview an executive of your choosing. In this
        interview, you will ask questions about the challenges faced by that executive
        with respect to leading people and teams, as well as the practices used by
        the executive to address his or her challenges. In your written submission,
        you will use course concepts to organize the major leadership challenges faced
        by the executive, highlight the strategies and practices used by the executive
        to address the core leadership challenges, and then to evaluate the effectiveness
        of the executive’s practices related to leading people and teams.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/71/1a0f90502a11e5a352932b5892ee29/lptcapstone.png","id":"B07TSjljEeWYbg7p2_3OHQ","slug":"leading-teams-project","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["3"],"name":"Leading

        course will examine the music industry in the United States, with the unique
        perspective gained by Vanderbilt University’s location in Nashville, TN.  Nashville
        is a major center of music in the United States, and the music created here
        has a global reach, particularly in the country, rock, pop, singer-songwriter,
        and Americana genres.  However, students will learn that the basic principles
        of recording, marketing, copyright, licensing, and live performance are the
        same, regardless of musical style or genre.\n\nThe music business is one of
        the most rapidly changing industries in the US today.  It is also an industry
        filled with contradiction, and media headlines and anecdotal stories often
        add to the confusion.  Here are just a few statements paraphrased from recent
        news stories: \n\n* The music business has collapsed\n* Demand for music is
        expanding at the greatest rate in history\n* Historic recording studios are
        closing at an alarming rate\n* More people are making recordings than ever
        before\n* Musicians usually lose money touring\n* Musicians usually make money
        touring\n* Major artist pulls songs off streaming services because they don’t
        pay fairly\n* Major artist makes a fortune from streaming services\n* People
        won’t buy records anymore\n* Vinyl record sales are soaring\n\nThis course
        will attempt to make sense of these seemingly contradictory trends and data,
        outline the basic structure and mechanisms of today’s music industry, and
        encourage students to think critically and entrepreneurially about the future
        of music.  Leaders from various areas of the music business will lend their
        perspectives through in-depth interviews, and footage from a recording session
        will give learners a behind the scenes look at how a song goes from the spark
        of an idea hummed into a cell phone to a finished recording.\n\nParticipants
        will grapple with questions about art and commerce which are both timeless
        and crucially important today, and will emerge from this course with tools
        allowing them to make more informed decisions as creators, promoters, and
        consumers of music.\n\nCourse launches February 19, 2016.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"music-and-art"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"entrepreneurship"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/67/1b0be066f311e5a4b96bf44ed2f2ff/musicbiz_logo-_1_.png","id":"Dvgs4iAXEeWKeQ6ae81EbQ","slug":"musicbiz","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["37"],"name":"Understanding

        by movies such as \"A Beautiful Mind\", game theory is the mathematical modeling
        of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents.  Over four
        weeks of lectures, this advanced course considers how to design interactions
        between agents in order to achieve good social outcomes. Three main topics
        are covered:  social choice theory (i.e., collective decision making and voting
        systems), mechanism design, and auctions.\n\nIn the first week we consider
        the problem of aggregating different agents'' preferences, discussing voting
        rules and the challenges faced in collective decision making. We present some
        of the most important theoretical results in the area: notably, Arrow''s Theorem,
        which proves that there is no \"perfect\" voting system, and also the Gibbard-Satterthwaite
        and Muller-Satterthwaite Theorems.  We move on to consider the problem of
        making collective decisions when agents are self interested and can strategically
        misreport their preferences. We explain \"mechanism design\" -- a broad framework
        for designing interactions between self-interested agents -- and give some
        key theoretical results. Our third week focuses on the problem of designing
        mechanisms to maximize aggregate happiness across agents, and presents the
        powerful family of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms.  The course wraps up
        with a fourth week that considers the problem of allocating scarce resources

        в конце 19 века исследователи обратили внимание на значимость роли медиа в
        социальных, политических, экономических, культурных процессах, а в 20 веке
        масс-медиа стали целой индустрией, производящей и воспроизводящей прообразы
        и репрезентации этих процессов, идеологии и картины мира. 21 век же ставит
        новые вопросы о том, что такое медиа и как они участвуют в формировании личности,
        конструировании социального пространства, политических режимов и в развитии
        экономики. \n\nОсновная цель курса – сформировать базовые представления о
        развитии медиа и нарисовать карту обширного поля медиатеорий. В связи с этим
        он состоит из двух частей – первая посвящена истории развития медиасистем,
        а вторая рассматривает ключевые теории медиа. \n\nПервая часть курса знакомит
        с основными технологическими вехами в развитии медиа и в то же время позволяет
        увидеть историю медиа как историю развития социального института. Основное
        внимание уделяется развитию институтов медиа преимущественно с момента появления
        национальных государств в Западной Европе до настоящего момента.  Курс рассматривает
        роль, которую играют медиа в формировании национальных идентичностей, капиталистической
        экономики, представлений о гражданских свободах и т.д. Отдельный модуль посвящен
        истории цензуры, поскольку история медиа тесно связана с этим явлением. \n\nВторая
        часть курса посвящена рассмотрению ключевых теоретических подходов к изучению
        медиа и коммуникаций, возникавших начиная с 1940-х годов и до сегодняшнего
        дня. Так, слушатели познакомятся с эмпирико-функционалистской и лингвистической
        группами медиа теорий, с идеями критической теории, парадигмой медиадетерминизма,
        теориями сетевого общества, с коммуникационным аспектом социологии технических

        algorithms, Part I\n\nHow efficiently can you pack objects into a minimum
        number of boxes? How well can you cluster nodes so as to cheaply separate
        a network into components around a few centers? These are examples of NP-hard
        combinatorial optimization problems. It is most likely impossible to solve
        such problems efficiently, so our aim is to give an approximate solution that
        can be computed in polynomial time and that at the same time has provable
        guarantees on its cost relative to the optimum. \n\nThis course assumes knowledge
        of a standard undergraduate Algorithms course, and particularly emphasizes
        algorithms that can be designed using linear programming, a favorite and amazingly
        successful technique in this area. By taking this course, you will be exposed
        to a range of problems at the foundations of theoretical computer science,
        and to powerful design and analysis techniques. Upon completion, you will
        be able to recognize, when faced with a new combinatorial optimization problem,
        whether it is close to one of a few known basic problems, and will be able
        to design linear programming relaxations and use randomized rounding to attempt
        to solve your own problem. The course content and in particular the homework
        is of a theoretical nature without any programming assignments.  \n\nThis

        three decades and longer we have heard educators and technologists making
        a case for the transformative power of technology in learning. However, despite
        the rhetoric, in many ways and at most institutional sites, education is still
        relatively untouched by technology. Even when technologies are introduced,
        the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the results seem disappointing.
        If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of
        knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the
        pen-and-paper test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment
        systems? Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant
        change. Technology might not even represent a step forward in education.\n\nBut
        what might be new? How can we use technologies to innovate in education?\n\nThis
        course explores seven affordances of e-learning ecologies, which open up genuine
        possibilities for what we call New Learning – transformative, 21st century
        learning:\n\n1. Ubiquitous Learning\n2. Active Knowledge Making\n3. Multimodal
        Meaning\n4. Recursive Feedback\n5. Collaborative Intelligence\n6. Metacognition\n7.
        Differentiated Learning\n\nThese affordances, if recognized and harnessed,
        will prepare learners for success in a world that is increasingly dominated
        by digital information flows and tools for communication in the workplace,
        public spaces, and personal life. This course offers a wide variety of examples
        of learning technologies and technology implementations that, to varying degrees,
        demonstrate these affordances in action.\n\n--------------------------------\nRecommended
        Background\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course is designed for
        people interested in the future of education and the \"learning society,\"
        including people who may wish to join education as a profession, practicing
        teachers interested in exploring future directions for a vocation that is
        currently undergoing transformation, and community and workplace leaders who
        regard their mission to be in part \"educative.\"\n\n--------------------------------\nTake
        this Course for Credit at the University of Illinois\n--------------------------------\n\nThis
        course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution
        by students in the e-Learning Ecologies course offered to graduate certificate,
        masters, and doctoral level students in the College of Education at the University
        of Illinois.\n\nOf course, in the nature of MOOCs many people will just want
        to view the videos and casually join some of the discussions. Some people
        say that these limited kinds of participation offer evidence that MOOCs suffer
        from low retention rates. Far from it – we say that any level of engagement
        is good engagement.\n\nOn the other hand, if you would like to take this course

        course offers a conceptual framework for understanding China that highlights
        the intersection of politics and economics. It shows that rather than develop
        into a full blown market economy, state and party officials at all levels
        of the political system maintain significant influence in economic development.
        Such a “political” economy has had both positive and negative outcomes, which
        we will assess in detail. We also look at the origins, views, backgrounds
        and relations among leaders, and how those leaders make decisions about public
        policy and try to get those decisions implemented down through the system.
        China has few formal institutions through which citizens can participate in
        politics, but we will study the strategies Chinese people use to try to influence
        their leaders’ decisions. Finally, we assess China’s future and whether rapid
        economic development and the emergence of a vibrant middle class will push
        China towards greater democracy or whether the single party system is likely
        to survive into the future. The course is a quite useful background for Chinese

        beautiful classical theory on field extensions of a certain type (Galois extensions)
        initiated by Galois in the 19th century. Explains, in particular, why it is
        not possible to solve an equation of degree 5 or more in the same way as we
        solve quadratic or cubic equations. You will learn to compute Galois groups
        and (before that) study the properties of various field extensions.\n\nWe
        first shall survey the basic notions and properties of field extensions: algebraic,
        transcendental, finite field extensions, degree of an extension,  algebraic
        closure, decomposition field of a polynomial. \nThen we shall do a bit of
        commutative algebra (finite algebras over a field, base change via tensor
        product) and apply this  to study the notion of separability in some detail.
        \nAfter that we shall discuss Galois extensions and Galois correspondence
        and give many examples (cyclotomic extensions, finite fields, Kummer extensions,
        Artin-Schreier extensions, etc.). \nWe shall address the question of solvability
        of equations by radicals (Abel theorem). We shall also try to explain the
        relation to representations and to topological  coverings. \nFinally, we shall
        briefly discuss  extensions of rings (integral elemets, norms, traces, etc.)
        and explain how to use the reduction modulo primes to compute Galois groups.\n\nPREREQUISITES
        \nA first course in general algebra — groups, rings, fields, modules, ideals.
        Some knowledge of commutative algebra (prime and maximal ideals — first few
        pages of any book in commutative algebra) is welcome. For exercises we also
        shall need some elementary facts about groups and their actions on sets, groups
        of permutations and, marginally, \nthe statement of Sylow''s theorems.\n\nASSESSMENTS\nA
        weekly test and two more serious exams in the middle and in the end of the
        course. For the final result, tests count approximately 30%, first (shorter)
        exam 30%, final exam 40%.\n\nThere will be two non-graded exercise lists (in

        course in the specialization will last six weeks and will focus on the second
        main building block of financial analysis and valuation: risk. The notion
        of risk and statistics are intimately related and we will spend a fair amount
        of time on the development of some statistical concepts and tools, namely
        distribution theory and regression analysis. This time will be well spent
        because these concepts and tools are also commonly used in many applications
        in the real world. The foundational idea of diversification will then be used
        to develop a framework for evaluating risk and establishing a relationship
        between risk and return. Apart from developing a keen appreciation of risk
        for making thoughtful decisions in an institutional context, this course will
        contain a lot of material and examples that will enable the learner to make
        smart personal investing decisions.  The course will again have time included

        first MOOOOO-C, you will gain a broad and comprehensive understanding of all
        aspects of dairy management such as genetics, nutrition, reproduction, animal
        health, farm economics, and sustainability of dairy production systems. There''s
        something here for everyone whether you are just looking for the basics or
        have years of experience in the dairy industry.\n\nThis is an eight-week course.
        Each week consists of four to nine video lectures, additional reading materials,
        and a multiple-choice questions quiz. Estimated study time is between three
        and five hours per week. Learners have the option to purchase a Course Certificate
        for 49.00 USD. The certificate can be purchased at any time, but you must
        verify your identify before taking the course quizzes in order to be eligible.
        For those who cannot afford the certificate fee, financial aid is available
        through Coursera.\n\nWhy is producing milk efficiently and sustainably so
        important? \n\nMilk provides humans with over 16 essential nutrients, such
        as: Energy, Protein and Essential Amino acids, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, several
        B vitamins, including B12, Pantothenic and Folic acids, and essential minerals
        such as Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc, as well as other
        minerals. Did you know that one glass of milk provides a 5-year old child
        with 21% of his/her daily protein requirements and 8% of their energy needs?\n\nMost
        milk in the world, about 85%, is produced from cattle. However, water buffaloes,
        goats, sheep, and camel are also dairy animals. The United States, India,
        the European Union, Brazil, and New Zealand are among the largest dairy producers
        in the world. Yet among these dairy-producing countries there are varied methods
        to generate milk with highly variable productivity and efficiency. Dairy production
        is vital for the survival of billions of people. Globally, around 150 million
        small-scale dairy households, equivalent to 750 million people, are engaged
        in milk production. The number and size of dairy farms varies among countries,
        but in India alone, there are estimated 78 million dairy farms! In the United
        States, one of the leading milk-producing countries in the world, total milk
        production has been steadily increasing in the last decades, reaching over
        205 billion pounds (93 billion kilograms) in 2014. This was accompanied by
        a steady increase in average milk yield per cow, reaching 22,260 lb (over
        10,100 kg) per lactation in 2014. How has this efficiency been achieved? What
        methods are necessary to ensure production of high quality milk? How do we
        balance milk production efficiency with animal health and environmental protection?
        This course will provide the student with information to better understand
        dairy production systems and their role in feeding the world population.\n\nIn
        this MOOOOO-C, you will learn about the dairy enterprise from internationally
        recognized dairy science professors who have delivered highly regarded dairy
        education programs within the United States and internationally.\n\nCourse
        Sponsors\n\nThis course was supported by the generous contributions of Innovation
        Center for US Dairy at Silver Level and Pancosma North America, RP Nutrients,
        Inc. and Arm and Hammer, which provided funding support at a Bronze Level.  The

        course will explore the dynamic factors affecting the health and wellbeing
        of young people around the world, and how important it is for individuals,
        communities and nations that we improve the health and life chances of this
        important population group.\n\nWith over 25% of the world’s population aged
        between 10 and 24 years, today’s generation of young people is the largest
        in human history. As the future leaders and drivers of growth, productivity
        and innovation, young people are our greatest assets, and investment in their
        health and wellbeing has social, economic and other benefits that continue
        across the lifespan and into the next generation.\n\nIn this course we will
        adopt a life-course framework to take a holistic view of youth health and
        wellbeing. We will explore changing patterns of adolescent health and development,
        including why adolescence is starting earlier and ending later; how puberty
        and adolescent brain development may shape future health; and how what happens
        in adolescence can affect the start to life for the next generation. We’ll
        also look at the major health and social issues affecting young people and
        ways of addressing these through policy, practice and programming.\n\nCOURSE
        FORMAT:\nThis course comprises short video lectures and interviews, required
        and recommended readings, online discussion, quizzes and written assignments.
        There is no required text for this course and all readings are provided.\n\nDO
        I HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS COURSE?\nNo- you may access 100% of material in this
        course for free. You are also welcome to do as much or as little of the course
        as you like, including all (or none!) of the assessment tasks- it all depends
        on your learning goals. The option to pay for this course is there for those
        who wish to receive a Course Certificate as evidence of completion (which
        does require you to attempt and successfully pass the assessment tasks). \n\nWHO
        IS THIS COURSE FOR?\nThis course will be relevant for anyone with an interest
        in the health and wellbeing of young people. You do not need to be of any
        particular personal or professional background to benefit from this course,
        but having some basic undergraduate study experience will be helpful to your
        learning (particularly if in a health related field).\n\nWHAT IS THE MOST
        INTERESTING THING I''LL LEARN IF I TAKE THIS COURSE?\nYou’ll learn how so
        much of what happens during adolescence can impact not only the future health
        of individuals, but the health of the next generation as well. You’ll develop
        a greater understanding of the key factors impacting upon youth health and
        learn how to be a better advocate for the health and wellbeing of young people.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"medicine-and-healthcare","domainId":"life-sciences"},{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5f/d19730def211e3a071032b18023e18/GAH-Image_Final.png","id":"-b8YhanFEeWABgp2r5zOmw","slug":"teen-health","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["33"],"name":"Global

        1 - Desenvolver um componente gamification (2 semanas) - Você irá desenvolver
        um componente reutilizável para calcular e gerenciar pontos e realizações
        de usuários dentro de um aplicativo. Você deve seguir uma especificação de
        requisitos padrão, que será fornecida pelos autores. Você deve aplicar as
        técnicas de desenvolvimento ágil aprendidas na especialização para desenvolver,
        usando a linguagem Java, um componente de software reutilizável para gamificação:
        um componente de gamificação.\n\nParte 2 - Escolher um componente de gamificação
        (1 semana) - Você terá acesso a cinco componentes de gamificação desenvolvidos
        por outros alunos (documentação e código fonte) e vai escolher um deles para
        usar em seu projeto. Você deve fornecer uma avaliação crítica dos cinco componentes,
        explicando a sua escolha com base nos conceitos apresentados na especialização.\n\nParte
        3 - Projetar e implementar uma aplicação Web com gamificação (5 semanas) -
        Você deve projetar e implementar um aplicativo da Web de sua escolha utilizando
        as técnicas aprendidas durante a especialização. A única restrição é que este
        projeto deve ter alguma característica de gamificação, como exemplificado
        em cada um dos cursos anteriores, para o qual você irá usar tanto o componente
        desenvolvido por você, como o desenvolvido por algum outro aluno e escolhido
        por você na etapa anterior.\n\nDurante todo o projeto desta aplicação, você
        deve manter um diário no qual irá relatar as práticas, princípios e técnicas
        que você está usando e porquê. Neste projeto, todo o conhecimento aprendido
        no curso pode e deve ser aplicado, incluindo-se a reutilização de seu componente
        e se o componente escolhido produziu ou não problemas quando integrado a sua
        aplicação Web.\n\nVocê deve usar a primeira semana deste terceiro passo para
        preparar o desenvolvimento ágil e executar uma iteração a cada semana seguinte,
        de acordo com a técnica TDD apresentada ou alguma outra mais avançada também
        apresentada nesta especialização.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"software-development"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e6/a59130b5b011e596ddffa17da4aea1/9-Badges--Capstone.png","id":"bIweR3eWEeWLqw7zlLhRzQ","slug":"projeto-final--aplicativo-para-web-com-componente-gamificado","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["pt-BR"],"partnerIds":["252"],"name":"Projeto

        is a course on social norms, the rules that glue societies together. It teaches
        how to diagnose social norms, and how to distinguish them from other social
        constructs, like customs or conventions. These distinctions are crucial for
        effective policy interventions aimed to create new, beneficial norms or eliminate
        harmful ones. The course teaches how to measure social norms and the expectations
        that support them, and how to decide whether they cause specific behaviors.
        We also look at a variety of tools policy makers may use to effect change,
        highlight the role of trendsetters in social change, and the conditions under
        which they can be successful. The course is a joint Penn-UNICEF project, and
        it includes many examples of norms that sustain behaviors like child marriage,
        gender violence and sanitation practices.\n\nThis is Part 1 of the Social
        Norms, Social Change series.  In these lectures, I introduce all the basic
        concepts and definitions, such as social expectations and conditional preferences,
        that help us distinguish between different types of social practices like
        customs, descriptive norms and social norms. Expectations and preferences
        can be measured, and these lectures explain how to measure them. Measurement
        is crucial to understand the nature of the practice you are facing, but also
        whether an intervention was or was not successful, and why.  In Part 2, we
        will examine social change, the tools we may use to enact change, and put
        into practice all we have learned in Part 1. \n\nAll students who successfully

        demand上线，在on demand上，我们将所有课程内容全部上载，没有教学时限，由学生自行安排学习时间和进度，自己完成课后练习，以便随时为需要的学生提供学习的资料和练习。练习题可以多次尝试，只是必须做对每个模块练习题的80%，才可以通过。又考虑到《电磁学》内容比较多，因此将原来十三周的教学内容分成两个学习阶段。《电磁学上》包含的内容是《大学物理通用教程》电磁学的前三章即静电场、导体和电介质以及直流电。这三部分内容属于恒定电场范畴，这些内容应该是深入学习电磁学的基础，在这部分课程结尾，设置了一个结业考试，相当于大学课程的期中考试。第二个学习进程《电磁学下》包含的内容是《大学物理通用教程》电磁学的后五章即恒磁场、磁介质，电磁感应、交流电和电磁场电磁波。建议大家学习了第一进程，通过了结业考试以后再进入第二学习进程《电磁学下》的学习。\n        本课程的课程是按照知识点设置模块，《电磁学上》包含5个模块，《电磁学下》包含6个模块。每个模块又包含几节课，每个模块结束有一个小测，同学们可以自我测试，没有时间限制，大家可以根据自己的需要和时间安排来自主学习，以免一步跟不上，步步跟不上，这对于学习我们这种理论性比较强的课是有利的，已经明白的可以跳过去，不清楚的可以重点学习。\n       《电磁学上》包含以下五个模块\n模块一      库仑定律和电场强度
        \n模块二      高斯定理和环路定理\n模块三      导体与静电平衡\n模块四      电介质与电场能量\n模块五      直流电\n欢迎大家选课！","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"physics-and-astronomy"}],"primaryLanguages":["zh-CN"],"partnerIds":["163"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5c/8a988013b611e4912df96cfa655a37/___-2-__.jpg","name":"电磁学上——恒定电场","id":"YXLa-lM0EeWEHRLwpfV5DQ","slug":"dianci"},{"courseType":"v1.session","specializations":[],"description":"Students

        cursos de Cálculo Diferencial y Cálculo Integral tradicionalmente se ofrecen
        separados y respetando ese orden. El primero estudia la derivada, y el segundo,
        la integral, siendo este momento en el que aparece el Teorema Fundamental
        del Cálculo (TFC) para establecer la relación entre ambos conceptos. En el
        presente curso vamos a hacer una diferencia: introduciremos la derivada y
        la integral como conceptos relacionados desde un principio. \n\nVamos a iniciar
        con la interpretación del Teorema Fundamental del Cálculo, con esto nos referimos
        a descubrir su significado real en la solución de problemas. Llegaremos a
        asociar con él la actividad práctica de calcular el valor de una magnitud
        que está cambiando. Habiendo realizado esta interpretación, los conceptos
        de derivada e integral se verán relacionados desde un principio, lo que te
        permitirá predecir el valor de una magnitud que está cambiando. Las nociones
        fundamentales de derivada e integral las identificaremos con las ideas de
        “razón de cambio” y de “acumulación del cambio”, y el TFC nos proveerá de
        la estrategia de solución.\n \nRecordarás que la Matemática Elemental incluye
        el Álgebra, la Geometría y la Geometría Analítica. Podemos decir que éstas
        son Matemáticas que estudian lo estático. En cambio, la Matemática Superior,
        que incluye el Cálculo, estudia lo dinámico. Con el Cálculo se inicia el estudio
        del cambio, una realidad presente en nuestro entorno cotidiano sin duda alguna.
        Costos, temperaturas, poblaciones, velocidades, energías, capitales de inversión,
        longitudes, etc., son algunos ejemplos de esto. En este curso podrás entender
        al Cálculo como una estrategia de solución para el estudio del cambio y diferenciarlo
        de las Matemáticas Elementales, aunque utilice de ellas bastante información.\n
        \nAl finalizar este curso podrás:\n\nDescribir de qué manera los modelos matemáticos
        polinomial, exponencial natural, y trigonométricos (seno y coseno), son una
        construcción que responde a esta práctica de predicción. Los verás a todos
        ellos surgir de esta práctica cuando una magnitud real particular cumple ciertas
        condiciones en su “razón de cambio” con respecto a la magnitud de la que depende.
        \n\nUtilizar la introducción de procesos infinitos (¡no imposibles!) en la
        construcción de la respuesta de predicción, con ello entenderás por qué se
        habla de Matemática Superior y de un pensamiento matemático avanzado.\n\nValorar

        mondialisation et l''européanisation favorisent le développement rapide des
        villes à travers le monde. L''urbanisation atteint de nouveaux sommets aujourd’hui
        avec l''essor des mégacités (plus de 15 millions d''habitants) comme Calcutta,
        Los Angeles, Dhaka, Le Caire, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico ou Séoul.
        Au-delà de la métropole moderne, les chercheurs tentent de donner un sens
        à ces grandes régions urbaines au moyen de concepts divers tels que « post-métropoles
        », « villes globales », et « régions métropolitaines globales ». Ce cours
        passera en revue les débats et les modèles de villes et métropoles actuels
        proposés par les sciences sociales afin d''en analyser et comparer les développements
        contemporains. Comment étudier ces villes quand elles deviennent des mégarégions
        urbaines, leur taille importe-t-elle et en quoi ? Assiste-t-on à la naissance
        d''un immense monde urbain ou, au contraire, au-delà de l''apparente convergence
        de processus de mondialisation complexes, compris dans leur relation avec
        le capitalisme mondial, est-il possible d''identifier des différenciations
        masquées et le renforcement de mondes urbains distincts ? Quel sens donner
        à ce monde urbain alors que les villes ne sont pas des unités indépendantes
        mais doivent être comprises non seulement en termes de territoires et d''enracinement
        mais également de relations, afin de prendre en compte les flux, la mobilité,
        les circulations ? Quelle pertinence peuvent avoir des concepts de sciences
        sociales développés en Occident pour l''analyse de la transformation de Lagos
        ? Jusqu''à quel point le développement systématique de nouvelles formes de
        comparaison entre les villes du Nord et du Sud peut-il faire évoluer les sciences
        sociales et contribuer à surmonter la tendance à privilégier les comparaisons
        entre nations ? \nPour l''instant, dans les conditions actuelles du capitalisme,
        les questions politiques, économiques, culturelles et sociales deviennent
        de plus en plus urbaines. Selon la conception moderne de la ville mondiale,
        caractérisée par la taille, par l''agrégation des logements, les divisions
        différenciées du travail, et la densité des interactions, plusieurs conceptions
        de la ville ont fini par s''entremêler et parfois s''opposer. Ces conceptions
        soulignent différents processus d''intégration : la ville matérielle et ses
        murs, ses places, ses maisons, ses routes, ses services, ses bâtiments, ses
        déchets, et son infrastructure physique ; la ville culturelle des imaginaires,
        des différences, des représentations, des idées, des symboles, des arts, des
        textes, des sens, des religions, et des esthétiques ; la politique et les
        politiques de la ville en termes de domination, de pouvoir, de gouvernement,
        de mobilisation, de politiques publiques, de sécurité sociale, d''éducation
        ; la ville sociale des révoltes, des inégalités ethniques, économiques et
        de genre, de la vie quotidienne et des mouvements sociaux ; et l’économie
        de la ville : la division du travail, l''échelle, la production, la consommation,
        le commerce.....\nLes questions urbaines classiques portant sur les inégalités,
        le logement, le gouvernement, l''intégration, se mêlent aux questions sur
        le tissu urbain, sur la mobilité et l''enracinement, sur le développement
        durable et les risques, sur l''apparition des villes « cyborg », sur le contrôle
        social et les émeutes, la culture urbaine, l''innovation, et le développement

        авторам использовать его для подготовки рукописей. LaTeX не очень прост в
        освоении, но обладает массой преимуществ перед популярными текстовыми процессорами
        и редакторами презентаций:\n  •  высококачественная верстка — текст выглядит
        «как в книжке»;\n  •  удобная работа со сложными математическими формулами;\n  •  отличная
        кросс-платформенная совместимость;\n  •  автоматизация многих рутинных процессов:
        нумерации формул, рисунков, таблиц, разделов документа, перекрестных ссылок,
        создания колонтитулов, оформления стилей заголовков и т. п.;\n  •  огромное

        тем первой недели лекций, до этого времени ничего устанавливать не нужно.
        Для освоения курса нужно будет иметь компьютер с быстрым доступом к интернету
        и возможностью устанавливать на него программное обеспечение. В дальнейшем
        при работе с собственными документами в LaTeX подключение к интернету будет
        необязательно.\n\nВ: Требуется ли предварительная подготовка для прохождения

        так давно получил распространение термин «большие данные», обозначивший новую
        прикладную область — поиск способов автоматического быстрого анализа огромных
        объёмов разнородной информации. Наука о больших данных ещё только оформляется,
        но уже сейчас она очень востребована — и в будущем будет востребована только
        больше.\nС её помощью можно решать невероятные задачи: оценивать состояние
        печени по кардиограмме, предсказывать зарплату по описанию вакансии, предлагать
        пользователю музыку на основании его анкеты в интернете.\n\nБольшими данными
        может оказаться что угодно: результаты научных экспериментов, логи банковских
        транзакций, метеорологические наблюдения, профили в социальных сетях — словом,
        всё, что может быть полезно проанализировать.\nСамым перспективным подходом
        к анализу больших данных считается применение машинного обучения — набора
        методов, благодаря которым компьютер может находить в массивах изначально
        неизвестные взаимосвязи и закономерности.\n\nНа факультете компьютерных наук
        ВШЭ и в Школе анализа данных есть люди, активно использующие машинное обучение
        и разрабатывающие новые подходы к нему. Именно они — преподаватели этого курса.\n\nВы
        изучите основные типы задач, решаемых с помощью машинного обучения — в основном
        речь пойдёт о классификации, регрессии и кластеризации. Узнаете об основных
        методах машинного обучения и их особенностях, научитесь оценивать качество
        моделей — и решать, подходит ли модель для решения конкретной задачи. Наконец,
        познакомитесь с современными библиотеками, в которых реализованы обсуждаемые
        модели и методы оценки их качества. Для работы мы будем использовать реальные
        данные из реальных задач.\n\nКраткая программа курса:\nНеделя 1. Введение.
        Примеры задач. Логические методы: решающие деревья и решающие леса.\nНеделя
        2. Метрические методы классификации. Линейные методы, стохастический градиент.\nНеделя
        3. Метод опорных векторов (SVM). Логистическая регрессия. Метрики качества
        классификации.\nНеделя 4. Линейная регрессия. Понижение размерности, метод
        главных компонент.\nНеделя 5. Композиции алгоритмов, градиентный бустинг.
        Нейронные сети.\nНеделя 6. Кластеризация и визуализация. Частичное обучение.\nНеделя
        7. Прикладные задачи анализа данных: постановки и методы решения.\n\nСлушателю
        нужно знать об основных понятиях математики: функциях, производных, векторах,
        матрицах. Для выполнения практических заданий потребуются базовые навыки программирования.
        Очень желательно знать Python. Задания рассчитаны на использование этого языка
        и его библиотек numpy, pandas и scikit-learn.\n\nЧтобы успешно завершить курс,
        нужно набрать проходную сумму баллов за тесты и практические задания, а также
        выполнить финальный проект, посвящённый решению прикладной задачи анализа
        данных.\n\nМы уверены, что этот курс будет полезен каждому, кто хочет постичь
        искусство предсказательного моделирования и освоить интеллектуальный анализ
        данных.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"machine-learning","domainId":"data-science"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a2/c23430579811e59644373576122c07/Ya-Icon-new-size.jpg","id":"01XLylXyEeWKXg4Y7_tPaw","slug":"vvedenie-mashinnoe-obuchenie","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["ru"],"partnerIds":["160"],"name":"Введение

        the music production process—including recording, editing, and mixing—and
        the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer.\n\nWith
        the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the
        tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made
        in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone
        can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software
        package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing
        music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.\n    \nKnowledge is
        where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there
        is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course
        will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following
        along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. \n\nWe
        will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive
        it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer,
        so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music
        production process. \n    \nOnce recorded, sound must be organized along a
        timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression
        of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary
        music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a
        piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project.
        We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music
        production and that all DAWs provide. \n\nAfter editing, sounds must be combined
        or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if
        you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware
        and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts,
        sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than
        the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified
        from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression,
        equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots
        of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.\n    \nIn the
        end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is
        a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools
        are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea
        in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to
        reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course
        will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"music-and-art"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/47/177f107cc211e58b0e75bcc028bad2/IMP.png","id":"e9PicBJhEeaoZBKRisF_Dw","slug":"technology-of-music-production","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["21"],"name":"The

        strategy is in transition. What used to work doesn''t anymore -- not necessarily.
        \n\nThis course prepares you to think strategically in an age when companies
        like Apple, Google, and Microsoft have become more valuable (in market cap
        terms) than companies like Exxon. Today, business value and competitive advantage
        arise more often from consumer perceptions of what is \"cool\" than from physical
        assets or economies of scale. \n\nIn this course -- the first of a three-course
        specialization tailored specifically for the age of creativity and innovation
        -- you will gear up for the challenges of strategy formulation and implementation
        in a 21st century business. \n\nAfter taking the course, you''ll be able to:\n-
        Explain why \"doing\" strategy is considered \"the high point of managerial

        преподавательский опыт которого делает курс «Физика в опытах. Часть 4. Волны
        и оптика» уникальным.\n\nЗачем учить этот курс?\n• Физика – наука экспериментальная.
        Лучше один раз увидеть, чем сто раз услышать или прочитать! \n• Именно эксперименты
        позволяют продемонстрировать и легко понять и простые, и сложные аспекты,
        которые традиционно преподаются в виде теоретического материала и математических
        моделей\n• Курс поможет Вам научиться использовать: \n   o эксперимент как
        способ постановки вопроса, \n   o эксперимент как инструмент изучения физического
        явления\n   o эксперимент как  форму ответа на вопрос\n• Очень часто достаточно
        «простые» физические вопросы имеют неожиданные ответы, которые зависят от
        конкретных условий проведения эксперимента. Демонстрация таких опытов и объяснение
        полученных в них результатов могут оказаться чрезвычайно интересными\n• Вы
        сможете увидеть применение изучаемых физических явлений в жизни, в технике
        и в быту\n• Изучая этот курс, вы восполните нехватку времени на экспериментальную,
        «живую» физику, которая ощущается в обычном учебном процесс\n\nЧему учит этот
        курс?\n• Пониманию широкого круга как простых, так и сложных физических явлений
        и процессов по тематике соответствующих разделов\n• Применению физических
        закономерностей для анализа различных физических явлений и процессов \n• Навыкам  использования
        эксперимента\n• Базовым знаниям по физике будущих инженеров и специалистов
        в различных областях деятельности.\n\nДля кого этот курс?\n• Для тех, кто
        изучает физику, и хочет прояснить для себя различные вопросы (в школе, в вузе)\n•

        an academic writer. The course provides instruction, exercises, structure,
        and deadlines needed to create a publishable paper.\n\nThe aim of the course
        is to improve competence in scholarly communications by deepening knowledge
        of the core features of the scientific writing style. It presents and analyzes
        the unwritten rules of scientific writing, the ones candidates most likely
        never learned in academic writing.\n\nThe course will enable the candidates
        to write clear, detailed and well-structured scientific texts appropriate
        to a suitable academic journal. In particular, they will develop an awareness
        of fundamental concepts of academic writing, such as contrastive rhetoric,
        logical organization, and argumentation. In addition, they will develop skills
        for self-editing and revision techniques, including editing\nfor precision
        and clarity. They will also gain a deeper understanding of how to prepare
        a scientific paper using the IMRAD format. Finally, the candidates will develop
        an enhanced understanding of the concept of academic integrity and the ethics

        European Union is one of the world’s largest and most important economies.
        This five week course is the first in a series of three that will provide
        students with an insight into European Business Law. The series ranges from
        considering the basic structures and principles of the European Union to focusing
        on various specialized areas of law. Each course will give the students an
        understanding of the laws and policies that regulate the internal market of
        European Union, as well as relevant case law and useful inputs from leading
        practitioners in the field. \n\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nThe course is useful
        to persons both inside and outside the European Union, whether they are students,
        professionals, or simply interested in the European Union and European Business
        Law. Prior knowledge of law and the European Union is an advantage, but not
        a prerequisite. We have added an introduction module in the first course providing
        students with an overview of the history, institutions and legal method of
        the European Union. \n\n\nAbout the Series\n\nIn the first course, Understanding
        the Fundamentals, we will examine the core structures and principles of the
        European Union as well as the main sources of law. In the second course, Doing
        business in Europe, we will focus on the main laws that regulate various aspects
        of establishing and running a business within the European Union. In the final
        course, Competing in Europe, we will go into more depth about how to compete
        on the internal market and protect your brand, product or invention. \n\nThe
        first course will start on January 11th 2016. We are currently working on
        the second and third courses in the series, and they will be launched in the
        spring of 2016. To keep up to speed on the course series, visit our Facebook
        page at:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/eblmooc/\n\n\nSyllabus and Format\n\nEach
        course consists of a number of modules where one module represents about one
        week of work. A module includes a number of lectures and readings, and finishes
        with a voluntary assessment – a quiz, a small peer graded assignment or a
        case law review. The assessments are intended to encourage learning and ensure
        that you understand the material of the course. Participating in forum discussions
        is voluntary. Please note that the syllabus of the second and third courses
        are subject to change, as they are being revised.\n\nCourse I - Understanding

        was founded in 1668. The Faulty of Law is a modern faculty with an international
        profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. The university
        offers two international Masters: European Business Law and Human Rights Law.
        The former provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the
        theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme
        provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework,
        which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business
        decision-makers. \n\nEducation, research and interaction with the surrounding
        community are the main focus of the Faculty’s work. The connection between
        the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by
        the university, including the university’s MOOC course in European Business
        Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal
        studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active
        lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-essentials"},{"subdomainId":"law","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4c/c09450ebc911e3b776713ecb7a4d38/European_draft3.png","id":"gSfwG3HcEeWLqw7zlLhRzQ","slug":"european-law-fundamentals","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["199"],"name":"European

        management today is faced with new challenges such as climate change or the
        effects of human activity. Public and private stakeholders who are active
        in this field must develop new ways to better manage the water cycle \"as

        the problems related to water management. Firstly, this course will define
        a resource and, more specifically, the resource of water. It will look at
        how water is used and the activities associated with it as well as any potential
        conflicts. The course will look at water management in detail through the
        analysis of the different types of rights and obligations associated with,
        for example, the development of a multi-sectorial regulation system or a watershed
        management approach.\n\nBy the end of this course, our aim is to enable you
        to:\n1) Identify the main issues and strategies linked to water resource management\n2)
        Acquire the key reading material needed to understand the many variables (environmental,
        institutional and political) which affect water and which, in terms of management,
        may require adjustment.\n\nThis course was developed by the Geneva Water Hub
        and is financed by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).
        Alongside researchers from the University of Geneva from a range of faculties,
        researchers from other universities and research centres will be involved

        de leur organisation et de leur fonctionnement, d’examiner les modes d’intervention
        qui visent leur revalorisation et intégration dans les structures formelles
        des villes qui les accueillent.\n\nLa croissance rapide des villes s’est accompagnée,
        sur l’ensemble des continents, de mécanismes parfois déroutants de production
        urbaine qui ont mis à mal les équilibres territoriaux et sociaux des agglomérations.
        \n\nA  l’heure actuelle, près d’un milliard de personnes dans le monde, vivent

        quartiers précaires où se concentre la pauvreté urbaine.\n\nL’existence et

        dans les économies émergentes. Les participants bénéficieront de l’expertise
        de praticiens, de hauts fonctionnaires d’état, et d’universitaires ayant une
        véritable expérience de terrain, sur les opportunités et les défis que présentent
        la mise en place et la maintenance d’infrastructures affectées aux services
        publics par des PPP efficaces.\n\nLe cours comprend des films vidéo, des lectures,
        des questionnaires et autres matériels d’apprentissage conçus et enseignés
        par des experts notamment de l’Université d’Harvard, l’Université John Hopkins,
        L’université de la Sorbonne, l’Université Panthéon-Assas, la Facilité Africaine
        de Soutien Juridique, la Banque d’Investissement Européenne, le Fond Monétaire
        International, l’Agence Française de Développement, et la Banque mondiale.\n\nCe
        cours vous apportera ce dont vous avez besoin pour mieux comprendre les PPP,
        que vous soyez un membre de la société civile, du grand public, un praticien,
        un fonctionnaire d’état ou un décideur politique.\n\n~~ A propos du cours\n\nPartout
        dans le monde et en particulier dans les pays en développement, les gouvernements
        rencontrent des difficultés pour mettre en place et maintenir les infrastructures
        nécessaires à la croissance économique de leur pays et à la prestation de
        services publics de base aux citoyens. Les partenariats public-privés (PPP)
        sont un des outils que les gouvernements peuvent utiliser pour contribuer
        à la mise en place de meilleurs services publics. Ce cours vous permettra
        de comprendre les principes clés des PPP et le rôle qu’ils peuvent jouer dans
        la réduction du déficit d’infrastructures. Le cours présentera les difficultés
        et les défis rencontrés lors de la sélection des projets jusqu’à leur mise
        en œuvre. Ainsi, vous améliorerez votre compréhension sur l’opportunité ou
        non de recourir à un PPP pour développer un projet d’infrastructure.\n\nDurant
        ce cours de quatre semaines, vous bénéficierez de l’expertise de praticiens,
        de hauts fonctionnaires d’état, et d’universitaires ayant une véritable expérience
        transactionnelle pour approfondir vos connaissances.\nPlusieurs ressources
        seront proposées chaque semaine, tels des films vidéos d’experts et de praticiens,
        des lectures obligatoires et facultatives, un questionnaire à choix multiples
        portant sur le thème de la semaine, et des exercices pour parfaire vos compétences
        d’analyse, de réflexion et de communication.\n\n~~ Semaine 1: Réduire le déficit
        d’infrastructure : le rôle des PPP\n\nCe premier module explique comment et
        pourquoi l’expertise et les ressources du secteur privé peuvent être mobilisées
        par les gouvernements pour contribuer à la réduction de leur déficit d’infrastructures.
        Ce module introduit le concept de PPP, ses caractéristiques, et les types
        de modalités contractuelles reflétant le degré de participation du secteur
        privé. Les PPP ne regroupent pas tous les contrats entre une personne publique
        et une personne privée, et ce module définit également ce que n’est pas un
        PPP. Des exemples d’échecs ou de PPP réussis seront utilisés pour illustrer
        les conditions optimales pour réussir des projets, et pour souligner la nécessité
        d’une analyse précise, ainsi que l’importance de la durabilité, la participation
        des acteurs et la bonne gouvernance des PPP.\n\n~~ Semaine 2: Prendre les
        bonnes décisions: les cadres législatifs et institutionnels dédiés aux PPP\n\nCe
        module examine les principes, valeurs et défis que requièrent la mise en place
        d’un cadre facilitant l’exécution des projets de PPP dans l’optique d’améliorer
        les services publics et l’investissement en infrastructure. Vous bénéficierez
        des leçons apprises lors de la réalisation des PPP et de leur incorporation
        dans des cadres législatifs efficaces. La semaine 2 vous apportera également
        une vue d’ensemble des différentes étapes du cycle de vie des PPP et approfondira
        la première phase : l’identification et la sélection des projets.\n\n~~ Semaine
        3: Susciter l’engagement du partenaire approprié: la passation des PPP\n\nCe
        module débute par une discussion sur la nécessité de développer des arguments
        commerciaux solides pour transformer un projet en PPP, et insiste sur l’importance
        de la structure du partenariat pour garantir une répartition des risques appropriée
        entre les commanditaires privés, les bailleurs de fonds, et le gouvernement.
        Ce module passe en revue les différentes étapes du processus d’appel d’offres
        et explique les défis rencontrés pour parvenir à un bon résultat, et explique
        le rôle des bailleurs qui sont souvent des acteurs clés dans la structuration
        de l’appel d’offre.\n\n~~ Semaine 4: Obtenir un partenariat réussi: la mise
        en œuvre du PPP \n\nCe module présente les aspects fondamentaux et les difficultés
        dans la gestion des contrats, tels que l’application de l’exécution du contrat,
        et sa renégociation ou sa résiliation. Enfin, ce module couvre la gestion
        des offres non sollicitées qui, bien qu’en dehors d’un processus de mise en
        concurrence, peuvent être une source d’idées innovantes.\n\n~~ Comment bénéficier
        au maximum de ce cours? Interagir et approfondir\n\nLes participants peuvent
        choisir l’un des deux parcours « Compréhension des PPP » ou « Politique et
        Pratique des PPP » en fonction de leur intérêt et objectifs professionnels.
        Le parcours « Compréhension des PPP » vise les personnes ayant un intérêt
        général pour les PPP et désirant améliorer leur compréhension du sujet. Le
        parcours permet aux auditeurs de se familiariser avec les concepts de base
        des PPP et leurs principaux outils, et offre la possibilité de communiquer
        avec des professionnels et des praticiens. Le parcours « Politique et Pratique
        des PPP » est destiné aux auditeurs souhaitant obtenir une meilleure connaissance
        des PPP et approfondir leur apprentissage.\n\nQuel que soit le parcours choisi,
        des questions seront soulevées et des points clés seront discutés sur le forum
        Coursera tout au long de la semaine. Nous espérons qu’en plus du forum de
        discussion, vous vous connecterez sur des réseaux sociaux (tels Twitter et
        Google+) pour profiter pleinement de votre participation au cours. Les membres
        de l’équipe de cette formation en ligne seront là pour vous aider à développer

        Il donne la possibilité d’acquérir rapidement les notions de base qui vous
        permettent de créer des bases de données spatiales et de fabriquer des cartes
        géographiques\n- Il s’agit d’un cours pratique qui repose sur l’utilisation
        de logiciels libres, notamment QGIS\nEn somme, si vos études ou votre profession
        comprennent des activités liées à la gestion de territoires, à l’analyse d’objets
        distribués dans l’espace géographique (aménagement du territoire, biologie,
        santé publique, écologie, énergie, etc.), ce cours est fait pour vous!\n\nEn
        suivant cette première partie du cours, vous explorerez les principes de base
        de la numérisation du territoire et du stockage des géodonnées. Vous apprendrez
        notamment à :\n- Caractériser des objets et/ou phénomènes spatiaux (modélisation
        du territoire) du point de vue de leur positionnement dans l’espace (systèmes
        de coordonnées et projections, relations spatiales) et en fonction de leur
        nature intrinsèque (mode objet ou vecteur vs. mode image ou raster), \n- Utiliser
        les diverses méthodes d’acquisition de données (mesure directe, géoréférencement
        d’images, digitalisation, source de données existantes, etc.)\n- Utiliser
        les divers modes de stockage des géodonnées – Fichiers simples et/ou bases
        de données relationnelles\n- Utiliser des outils de modélisation des données
        pour décrire et implémenter une base de données \n- Créer des requêtes dans
        le langage d’interrogation et de manipulation des données\n\nLa seconde partie

        the advent of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century, most scientists
        believed that it should be possible to predict the behavior of any object
        in the universe simply by understanding the behavior of its constituent parts.
        For instance, if one could write down the equations of motion for every atom
        in a system, it should be possible to solve those equations (with the aid
        of a sufficiently large computing device) and make accurate predictions about
        that system’s future.\n\nHowever, there are some systems that defy this notion.
        Consider a living cell, which consists mostly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
        along with other trace elements. We can study these components individually
        without ever imagining how combining them in just the right way can lead to
        something as complex and wonderful as a living organism! Thus, we can consider
        life to be an emergent property of what is essentially an accumulation of
        constituent parts that are somehow organized in a very precise way.\n\nThis
        course lets you explore the concept of emergence using examples from materials
        science, mathematics, biology, physics, and neuroscience to illustrate how
        ordinary components when brought together can collectively yield unexpected,
        surprising behaviors.\n\nNote: The fractal image (Sierpinkski Triangle) depicted

        course, part 2 of a 2-course sequence, examines the history of rock, primarily
        as it unfolded in the United States, from the early 1970s to the early 1990s.
        This course covers the music of Led Zeppelin, the Allman Brothers, Carole
        King, Bob Marley, the Sex Pistols, Donna Summer, Michael Jackson, Madonna,
        Prince, Metallica, Run-DMC, and Nirvana, and many more artists, with an emphasis
        both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how
        developments in the music business and in technology helped shape the ways
        in which styles developed. \n\nEmerging out of the experimental and ambitious
        years of late-60s psychedelia, rock splintered into a variety of styles in
        the 1970s as the music business continued to expand. By the end of the decade,
        punk and disco had challenged the excesses of the hippie aesthetic, as rock
        became more commercially streamlined and radio friendly. The emergence and
        rise of MTV transformed pop music and propelled the careers of Michael jackson
        and Madonna, while heavy metal and hip hop dominated the late 1980s. Nirvana
        leads alt-rock''s return to simplicity in the early 1990s.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"music-and-art"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["60"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/41/f3a2983b3f19b2b7fdb9f1e047692d/HistoryofRockLogo2pt2.jpg","name":"History

        you really care about the big questions in the economies and societies of
        the 21st century, such as distributive justice - namely, inequality of income
        or wealth, and its correlation with economic growth - this course is meant
        for you. The knowledge you will gain can truly change your outlook on our
        world.\n\n\"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - the Role of the State\"
        is the first part of a two part course and it includes the following four
        lectures: \n(1) What do we need a state for? \n(2) The Relationship between
        Efficiency and Distributive Justice \n(3) Demonstrating the implications of
        different ethical theories  \n(4) Distributive Justice: measurement and implications\nOnce
        you''ve completed the first part, we strongly recommend that you register
        for the second part entitled: \"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice -
        Maximizing Social Well-being\", as well. Taking both parts of the course would
        enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic
        Growth and Distributed Justice.\n\nThe course is founded upon the elemental
        idea that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply
        the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using
        only simple words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle
        the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths – both intuitive and
        unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however
        focus on policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable
        to all countries around the globe.\n\nThe course touches upon the essence
        of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty,
        gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work
        of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent
        system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social
        welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic
        angle:\n• Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how
        smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats
        to our planet;\n• Technology as the engine of economic growth;\n• Taxing the
        rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose
        a global tax on capital?\n\nThe curriculum includes interviews with major
        figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard''s Elhanan Helpman,
        Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and
        NYU.\n\nAfter successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able
        to:\n• better understand economic issues presented in the media\n• form an
        informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic
        policies\n• define and measure inequality and poverty\n• define the connection
        between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth\n• explain the foundations
        of economic growth\n• design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness
        of individuals\n\nAll these will allow you to better understand the policies
        being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their
        development, as a conscientious citizen.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"law","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f4/d44a90ad3a11e5a1295552b2c67443/Economic-Growth-_-Distributive-Justice.jpg","id":"0mS2lqJaEeW1Bw7HN8tFsw","slug":"economic-growth-part-1","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["110"],"name":"Economic

        course introduces participants from the healthcare sector to gender based
        violence (GBV), including global epidemiology of GBV; health outcomes; seminal
        research; and clinical best practices for GBV prevention, support, and management.
        A core curriculum is supplemented by lectures that contextualize the content
        with specific examples and programs from around the world. The core curriculum
        introduces learners to a global perspective on gender based violence (GBV),
        and includes a review with Dr. Claudia Garcia-Moreno of the new WHO guidelines
        on responding to violence. Students who wish to receive Honors Recognition
        will complete the honors module, which expands on the core material and highlights
        special circumstances and programs. \n\nThis is an in-depth course with 2
        components: \n1) Core curriculum introduces GBV from a global perspective,
        with an emphasis on ensuring a strong health sector response to GBV and teaching
        key competencies for social workers, physicians, nurses, midwives, community
        health workers, counselors, and other healthcare workers. Completion of the
        core content is required for students to pass the course. \n2) Honors curriculum
        offered by experts from around the world helps students dive deeper into certain
        issues, and touches on unique populations and specialized topics. Completion
        of Honors curriculum is required for those students who wish to receive a
        Certificate of Accomplishment with Honors.\n\nAfter taking the course, students
        will be able to:\n●\tDescribe the global epidemiology of leading forms of
        GBV and the evidence linking GBV to poor health.\n●\tArticulate the challenges,
        strategies, and WHO guidelines for integrating GBV response within the health
        sector. \n●\tDescribe the components of a comprehensive clinical assessment,
        treatment, and management of a GBV survivor.\n●\tDescribe the appropriate
        psychosocial support and management of a GBV survivor.\n\nModule 1 – Introduction
        to GBV- Epidemiology and Health Impact\nGBV comes in a variety of forms, each
        with health consequences for the survivor. An understanding of these issues
        helps inform a comprehensive and multi-sectorial response for preventing and
        responding to GBV. \n\nModule 2 – Health Care Response, Screening, and Psychosocial
        Support\nRecognition of health impacts of GBV has led to calls to address
        GBV within the health sector. Support for GBV survivors extends beyond clinical
        exam and assessment. Safety planning, harm reduction, and access to psychosocial
        support must be ensured. \n\nModule 3 – Clinical Care for GBV Survivors\nCaring
        for GBV survivors requires compassionate, confidential, and nondiscriminatory
        clinical assessment. Competent medical and forensic examination, along with
        appropriate documentation, is essential.\n\nHonors Module – In-Depth Information
        and Special Topics\nThis module provides additional materials for those who
        wish to explore specialized topics and gain a more advanced grasp of the complexities
        of addressing gender-based violence. Core course topics are expanded upon,
        and special populations and programs are highlighted. Special topics include
        violence in humanitarian settings, against adolescents and sex workers, and
        human trafficking. Further information is provided on epidemiology, policy,
        and ethical guidelines, as well as the use of mHealth in GBV screening and
        care. We’ll cover the unique challenges of GBV research, and explore programs
        that encourage men and boys to be engaged in the prevention of violence against
        women. \n\nAcknowledgments\nThis course is a project of the Johns Hopkins

        Однако специалисты по анализу данных редко оказываются в такой идеальной ситуации.
        Обычно перед ними ставят задачи, которые нуждаются в уточнении формулировки,
        выборе метрики качества и протокола тестирования итоговой модели. Данные,
        с которыми нужно работать, часто представлены в непригодном виде: они зашумлены,
        содержат ошибки и выбросы, хранятся в неудобном формате и т. д.\n\nВ этом
        курсе мы разберем прикладные задачи из различных областей анализа данных:
        анализ текста и информационный поиск, коллаборативная фильтрация и рекомендательные
        системы, бизнес-аналитика, прогнозирование временных рядов. На их примере
        вы узнаете, как извлекать признаки из разнородных данных, какие при этом возникают

        this course even non-technical students can gain basic proficiency in health
        informatics: the application of computing to healthcare delivery, public health
        and community-based clinical research. The overall course paradigm is the
        Institute of Medicine''s vision of a \"Learning Health System\" that uses
        data from actual patient care to gain new knowledge and feeds that knowledge
        back as care is delivered to achieve a safer, higher quality and more cost
        effective health delivery system. Module 1 covers the US healthcare delivery
        system''s unique structural, economic and policy issues and the strategic
        role for health informatics. It also looks at the federal programs to encourage
        adoption of electronic record systems. Module 2 gives a high level overview
        of some key health standards with a particular emphasis on the new Fast Healthcare
        Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard. Module 3 explores how these technologies
        are being deployed and some of their current limitations using specific commercial
        and open source systems as examples. It features an interview with the developers
        of an innovative, new EHR. Module 4 presents examples of cutting edge research

        this project-centered course, you will learn everything you need to research
        and present an effective and persuasive position paper or policy advice. We
        recommend you sign up for a certificate as this course is on premium grading
        and you will only enjoy the full benefit of the project if you can join in
        with the assignments. In addition this course contains the exciting opportunity
        to research and analyze historical decisionmaking, international relations,
        business cases and battles  in an effort to truly understand constructing
        a convincing argument.\n\nMost important decisions in life, and many unimportant
        ones, are taken after some degree of reflection. If those decisions affect
        other people, we may take some advice and we might even follow it. The larger
        the issue and the greater number of people involved, the more likely that
        advice process will be institutionalised. Most of us tend to think of policy
        advice in the context of things as counsel to politicians in matters of national
        security or policy-making by governments. Of course, we also know that it
        takes place on a regular basis within businesses and other organisations.
        But it also happens in local politics and in local campaigns and in everyday
        life. Every time you try to influence someone’s decision, you are offering
        policy advice. Even if you are not planning to be an active advisor, the discipline
        of collecting and arranging the necessary materials is useful in all kinds
        of research and writing exercises. Writing a policy advice is what we call
        a ‘transferrable skill’.\n\nThe course requires an academic approach, but
        no previous experience. The projects can be completed by both novices and
        advanced learners. One thing is certain. Both groups will learn a lot from
        the experience. \n\nWhat is a policy advice?\nIn its simplest form, a policy
        advice is a short paper that argues your position on a particular issue and
        the course of action you propose. It also tries to convince the audience to
        adopt your position and to take action on your advice. \n\nWhat advice can
        I give?\nYou may well have a topic already, based on your work or your social
        situation. This could be a piece of equipment your firm might want to buy
        or a new market it might wish to enter. It could be a campaign for a local
        play area or against pollution in local ground-water. In this case it is a
        question of arranging and presenting your position, and discussing it with
        others in a similar position.\n\n On the other hand, you might be open for
        suggestions. In this case, we have prepared some topics covering business
        case studies, issues of current affairs, and historical examples. For example,
        you could look into the archives advise Harry Truman to adopt a different
        policy towards the Soviet Union at the start of the Cold War. Alternatively
        you could suggest advise the Incas in 1532 not to be so trusting in their
        dealings with the Spanish. After all, you will know the outcome. So the course
        should appeal to everyone interested in practical policy-making as well as
        amateur historians, strategy gamers. Everyone can have fun applying these
        techniques to their favourite topics.\n\nWhat will I learn?\nThe project-based
        course is designed so that you learn by doing rather than by listening. The
        assignments that you complete, the feedback that you receive and the assignments
        of others that you read and upon which you comment are all intrinsic parts
        of the course. The lectures are designed to act as signposts along the way
        and the readings allow you to explore some of the issues in greater depth.
        During the whole course experience you will learn to:\n•\tFrame a starting
        position for your own research\n•\tUse search engines to locate materials
        required for your advice\n•\tExplore ‘academic’ data-bases\n•\tAnnotate your
        sources correctly\n•\tTarget your research for statistical data\n•\tChoose
        a visualisation for your statistical data \n•\tConstruct an argument in a
        logical manner\n•\tBuild up the logic in each paragraph \n•\tConduct a SWOT
        analysis\n•\tConduct a Risk Analysis\n•\tPresent the materials in a position
        paper\n•\tConvert the position paper to a policy advice\n•\tRecognise the
        policy-making hierarchy and shaping the advice accordingly \n•\tWrite a powerful
        and effective PowerPoint presentation\n•\tPlace your project in the ‘real
        world’ context of the policy-cycle\n•\tAnd ... Discover a great, great deal
        about your chosen topic.\n\nHow much time will the course take?\nThe lecture
        materials in each module will themselves take no more than 30 minutes to view
        and review. Each module is accompanied by selected reading materials, but
        these are not compulsory. There is also a Skills Lab with extra literature
        and videos to assist you to improve your writing, computer and presentation
        skills. Combining these parts of the course, and assuming that you make some
        use of all the facilities offered, the ‘on-platform’ time should take no more
        than an one hour for each module. \nThe project-time depends on the degree
        of advancement in the project choice. If you come with a ready prepared idea
        and knowledge of the area, then the project-time should in total be approximately
        four to five hours. If you decide to use the suggestions in our collections,
        then you should add another three to four hours to familiarise yourself with
        the subject and the necessary materials. If you should decide to start a completely
        new project from scratch, the you would need to add another three hours or
        so to orient yourself in the problem and then locating the required materials.\n\nAbout

        realizado iterativamente unos desplazamientos entre teoría y práctica, integrando
        lo mejor de los dos mundos, pero siempre con un enfoque en el tema particular
        de cada curso. Aquí, el objetivo es lograr que tú como emprendedor lleves
        cada una de las dimensiones de la empresa a un desempeño muy alto, y más allá
        de esto, que la ventaja de la empresa se vea apuntalada por claras sinergias
        entre los distintos componentes. Esta suma de fortalezas lleva a que las capacidades
        sean difíciles de replicar y a que la ventaja sea sostenible. \n\nEn este
        curso harás una evaluación integral del negocio, identificarás barreras que
        debes resolver y generarás soluciones creativas que te permitan superar estas
        restricciones, actuando al mismo tiempo en los distintos niveles que ahora
        manejas (el ajuste entre el producto y el consumidor, la composición del modelo
        de negocio y la agilidad con las cifras de la empresa). Al cerrar este curso,
        habrás activado tu capacidad para conducir tu emprendimiento con mano certera  y
        de comunicarlo desde una perspectiva integral. Contarás con una amplia gama
        de recursos para generar nuevas estrategias de crecimiento. \n\nDurante el

        global security. A diverse team of experts in this emerging field has come
        together to help you contextualize your experiences as a new or seasoned global
        health responder. \n\nBy the end of this course, you will be enlightened about
        the changing world you live in, and have a much better understanding of the
        machinations on how organizations and governments are striving to improve
        health worldwide.  You''ll also learn how to keep yourself safe and be a savvy
        participant in the global health arena. You''ll be prepared to travel and
        to take your skills to chronic/emergent situations and help respond to the
        pressing needs while participating in global health activities throughout
        the world.\n\nWeek one will serve as an introduction to global health concepts
        with a look at changing trends in the 21st century; urbanization, environmental
        stress and resource scarcity. During week two, we will dive into global health
        security: food, water, energy, and the threats of a changing climate. Week
        three will cover the global burden of disease, infectious disease, the rise
        of non-communicable diseases, mental health, and access to care. During week
        four, we will learn about the stakeholders in global health: NGOs, governments,
        non-state actors; understanding where the money comes from, how it is allocated
        and the challenges of measuring results; human rights: what are they and how
        are they protected? During week five, we move onto complex humanitarian emergencies:
        forced migrations, wars, response standards, and the legal basis for interventions.
        Finally, during week six, we will end our course by learning how to be an
        effective participant--caring for yourself: pre-travel preparation, understanding
        risks when traveling outside your home country, and physiologic vulnerability.\n\nThis

        500,000 people in the United States and over 8 million people worldwide are
        dying every year from cancer. As people live longer, the incidence of cancer
        is rising worldwide and the disease is expected to strike over 20 million
        people annually by 2030. This open course is designed for people who would
        like to develop an understanding of cancer and how it is prevented, diagnosed,
        and treated.\n\nThe course introduces the molecular biology of cancer (oncogenes
        and tumor suppressor genes) as well as the biologic hallmarks of cancer. The
        course also describes the risk factors for the major cancers worldwide, including
        lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, and
        stomach cancer. We explain how cancer is staged, the major ways cancer is
        found by imaging, and how the major cancers are treated.\n\nIn addition to
        the core materials, this course includes two Honors lessons devoted to cancers
        of the liver and prostate.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you
        will be able to:\n\n- Identify the major types of cancer worldwide. (Lecture
        1)\n- Describe how genes contribute to the risk and growth of cancer. (Lecture
        2)\n- List and describe the ten cellular hallmarks of cancer. (Lecture 3)\n-
        Define metastasis, and identify the major steps in the metastatic process.
        (Lecture 4)\n- Describe the role of imaging in the screening, diagnosis, staging,
        and treatments of cancer. (Lecture 5)\n- Explain how cancer is treated. (Lecture
        6)\n\nWe hope that this course gives you a basic understanding of cancer biology
        and treatment. The course is not designed for patients seeking treatment guidance
        – but it can help you understand how cancer develops and provides a framework
        for understanding cancer diagnosis and treatment.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"clinical-science","domainId":"life-sciences"},{"subdomainId":"medicine-and-healthcare","domainId":"life-sciences"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3c/407a30e21411e5883d236f4d099647/Cancer_MOOC_icon.jpg","id":"q78Cq1x8EeW9BBKT5ztNhQ","slug":"cancer","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["8"],"name":"Introduction

        perfect data science experience? The data pull went perfectly. There were
        no merging errors or missing data. Hypotheses were clearly defined prior to
        analyses. Randomization was performed for the treatment of interest. The analytic
        plan was outlined prior to analysis and followed exactly. The conclusions
        were clear and actionable decisions were obvious. Has that every happened
        to you? Of course not. Data analysis in real life is messy. How does one manage
        a team facing real data analyses? In this one-week course, we contrast the
        ideal with what happens in real life. By contrasting the ideal, you will learn
        key concepts that will help you manage real life analyses. \n\nThis is a focused
        course designed to rapidly get you up to speed on doing data science in real
        life. Our goal was to make this as convenient as possible for you without
        sacrificing any essential content. We''ve left the technical information aside
        so that you can focus on managing your team and moving it forward.\n\nAfter
        completing this course you will know how to:\n\n1, Describe the “perfect”
        data science experience\n2. Identify strengths and weaknesses in experimental
        designs\n3. Describe possible pitfalls when pulling / assembling data and
        learn solutions for managing data pulls.\n4. Challenge statistical modeling
        assumptions and drive feedback to data analysts\n5. Describe common pitfalls
        in communicating data analyses\n6. Get a glimpse into a day in the life of
        a data analysis manager.\n\nThe course will be taught at a conceptual level
        for active managers of data scientists and statisticians.  Some key concepts
        being discussed include:\n1. Experimental design, randomization, A/B testing\n2.
        Causal inference, counterfactuals, \n3. Strategies for managing data quality.\n4.
        Bias and confounding\n5. Contrasting machine learning versus classical statistical

        проекте, разработанном  Высшей школой экономики в партнерстве с Инвестиционной
        компанией «Фридом Финанс», слушателям предлагается сформировать инвестиционный
        портфель по заданным критериям, рассчитать его доходность и показатели  риска  для
        двух сценариев развития экономики (оптимистичного и пессимистичного). Дополнительные
        материалы для выполнения заданий представят партнеры ИК «Открытие» и СПб биржа.
        \n\nПроект реализуется поэтапно с 4 взаимными оцениваниями. Самый весомый
        – последний этап, когда для физического лица (заказчика) формируется по-сценарно
        портфель, учитывающий  различные цели заказчика на горизонте 3-5 лет. На первой
        неделе слушатели критически оценивают предложенный консультантом инвестиционный
        портфель (выступают как консультанты-эксперты, критики), а на втором-четвертом
        этапе (неделях) самостоятельно формируют несколько портфелей (консервативный,
        средне-рискованный) из предложенных инструментов, сопоставляя и оценивая их
        с помощью технического и фундаментального анализа, а также принимая во внимание
        соответствие выбора инструментов заявленным целям заказчика. \nНа заключительном  этапе
        формируется сбалансированный портфель из инструментов по выбору слушателя
        и оценивается его доходность и риски для оптимистичного и пессимистичного
        сценариев.\n\nФормирование портфелей предполагается на разные временные горизонты
        (3 года, 5 лет), когда риск сглаживается как диверсификацией капитала в портфеле,
        так и включением низко-рискованных активов (государственных облигаций).\nДля
        наполнения средне-рискованного портфеля активами на срок от 3-х лет от слушателя
        будет требоваться сопоставление акций по инвестиционной привлекательности,
        принимая во внимание фундаментальные показатели деятельности компании и  ликвидность
        акций. \nКонсервативный портфель предполагает ранжирование облигаций и поиск
        высоконадежных из предложенного набора, отбор защитных акций с низким коэффициентом
        бета и оптимизацию весов активов в портфеле.\nОбщение со слушателями на форуме
        обеспечит как ассистент курса, так и сотрудники  ИК «Фридом Финанс» (ответят
        на вопросы слушателей, поделятся опытом и личным мнением).\n\nДля каждого
        из рассматриваемых портфелей в соответствии с профилем инвестора предполагается
        расчет общих и чистых (после уплаты налогов и комиссионных при заданных налоговых
        ставках и наличии предусмотренных законодательством льгот) выгод инвестирования,
        отдачи на вложенный капитал.\n\nПо итогам представленного проектного курса
        слушатели на практике вспомнят проблематику курсов специализации, составят
        инвестиционные портфели и обоснуют  доходность и риск  по ним, увяжут выбор
        портфеля с описанной в задании ситуацией, а также познакомятся с примером  формулирования

        module by introducing the key macroeconomic variables and explaining how they
        are defined and measured in order to enable the students to interpret macroeconomic
        data properly.\n\nIn the second module, the course offers a perspective for
        separating out various parts of the economy driven by different processes
        and for combining those components to develop a richer view of the whole.
        In particular, it applies this approach to the analysis of the relationship
        of the trade deficit with the budget deficit and private savings, offering
        insights about some key determinants of the balance of payments.\n\nThe third
        and fourth modules focus on the analyses of the foreign currency and money
        markets to provide fundamental models of the interest rate and exchange rate
        determination. They also discuss how these variables interact with each other
        and with the macroeconomic conditions, particularly monetary policy and the
        expectations about the future trends in the economy. These analyses lay the
        foundation for more comprehensive models of the macroeconomy in the next course
        of the Managerial Economics and Business Analysis Specialization.\n\nAt the

        last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions
        that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009
        is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus
        and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored
        by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin
        the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten
        traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.\n\nThree features
        of the new system are central.\n\nMost important, the intertwining of previously
        separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new
        dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those
        vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation
        by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in
        an effort to stem the collapse.  \n\nSecond, the global character of the crisis
        has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in
        postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central
        bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that
        cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary
        order. \n\nThird, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key
        derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange
        swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor
        can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial
        theory. That''s the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets
        and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers
        of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["40"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/cc/b0ac36a966ffee99bfc29ffa4669ac/institute_pgm_1_600x340.jpg","name":"Economics

        issues have always been important in international relations, but in recent
        years may have become even more important than in the past due to the widespread
        awareness of existing limits to energy sources and negative climate impacts.
        The course discusses global trends in energy consumption and production, various
        available scenarios for potential developments in the coming decades, the
        availability of oil reserves and the evolution of the oil industry. It then
        discusses natural gas and highlights the differences between oil and gas.
        It will also discuss renewable energy sources, nuclear energy and EU energy
        policy.\n\nThe course aims at providing students whose main interest is in
        international relations a background on energy resources, technology and economic
        realities to allow them to correctly interpret the political impact of current
        developments. It also aims at providing students, who already have a technical
        background in energy science or engineering, with the broad global view of
        energy issues that will allow them to better understand the social, economic
        and political impact of their technical knowledge.\n\n\nABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR
        :\n\nGiacomo Luciani\n\nScientific Advisor for the Master in International
        Energy at the Paris School of International Affairs (PSIA) Sciences Po, Giacomo
        Luciani is also Adjunct Professor at the Graduate Institute of International
        and Development Studies, Geneva and Director of the Executive Master in International
        Oil and Gas Leadership. For the period 2010-13 he was appointed Princeton

        of Near Eastern Studies. His research focuses on the political economy of
        the Middle East and North Africa and on global energy issues.\n\nRECOMMENDED
        BACKGROUND :\n\nThe course requires no special scientific, mathematical or
        economic background; all key concepts are clearly and elementarily explained.
        It is expected that it will be of interest to undergraduate and graduate students
        in schools where an equivalent course is not offered (this being the case
        for the vast majority of schools).\n\n\nUSPC\nSorbonne Paris Cité\nSupported

        course introduces the Bayesian approach to statistics, starting with the concept

        philosophy of the Bayesian approach as well as how to implement it for common
        types of data. We will compare the Bayesian approach to the more commonly-taught
        Frequentist approach, and see some of the benefits of the Bayesian approach.
        In particular, the Bayesian approach allows for better accounting of uncertainty,
        results that have more intuitive and interpretable meaning, and more explicit
        statements of assumptions. This course combines lecture videos, computer demonstrations,
        readings, exercises, and discussion boards to create an active learning experience.
        For computing, you have the choice of using Microsoft Excel or the open-source,
        freely available statistical package R, with equivalent content for both options.
        The lectures provide some of the basic mathematical development as well as
        explanations of philosophy and interpretation. Completion of this course will
        give you an understanding of the concepts of the Bayesian approach, understanding

        to Avoid Fallacies\n\nThink Again: How to Reason and Argue\nReasoning is important.
        This series of four short courses will teach you how to do it well. You will
        learn simple but vital rules to follow in thinking about any topic at all
        and common and tempting mistakes to avoid in reasoning. We will discuss how
        to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians,
        used car salesmen, and teachers) and how to construct arguments of your own
        in order to help you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will
        be useful in dealing with whatever matters most to you.\n\nCourses at a Glance:\nAll
        four courses in this series are offered through sessions which run every four
        weeks. We suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability.
        If for whatever reason you fall behind, feel free to re-enroll in the next
        session.We also suggest that you start each course close to the beginning
        of a month in order to increase the number of peers in the discussion forums
        who are working on the same material as you are. While each course can be
        taken independently, we suggest you take the four courses in order.\n\nCourse
        1 - Think Again I: How to Understand Arguments\nCourse 2 - Think Again II:
        How to Reason Deductively\nCourse 3 - Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively\nCourse
        4 - Think Again IV: How to Avoid Fallacies\n\nAbout This Course in the Series:\nWe
        encounter fallacies almost everywhere we look. Politicians, salespeople, and
        children commonly use fallacies in order to get us to think what they want
        us to think. Think Again: Fallacies will show how to identify and avoid many
        of the fallacies that people use to get us to think the way they want us to
        think.\n\nIn this course, you will learn about fallacies. Fallacies are arguments
        that suffer from one or more common but avoidable defects:  equivocation,
        circularity, vagueness, etc. It’s important to learn about fallacies so that
        you can recognize them when you see them, and not be fooled by them. It’s
        also important to learn about fallacies so that you avoid making fallacious
        arguments yourself.\n\nSuggested Readings\nStudents who want more detailed
        explanations or additional exercises or who want to explore these topics in
        more depth should consult Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal
        Logic, Ninth Edition, Concise, Chapters 13-17, by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong
        and Robert Fogelin.\n\nCourse Format\nEach week will be divided into multiple
        video segments that can be viewed separately or in groups. There will be short
        ungraded quizzes after each segment (to check comprehension) and a longer
        graded quiz at the end of the course.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"},{"subdomainId":"philosophy","domainId":"arts-and-humanities"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera.s3.amazonaws.com/topics/thinkagain/large-icon.png","id":"wywOj9ZqEeWoww7Hc7148Q","slug":"logical-fallacies","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["7"],"name":"Think

        combinations we can expect firms to select in cases of monopolistic competition
        and oligopoly. We will also analyze monopolies from an efficiency perspective
        and look at the effects of imperfect information on firm and consumer behavior.
        We will next turn to exploring input markets and what determines the demand
        for an input by a firm, an industry, and the overall market. We will also
        look at the factors that affect input supply and how the supply of an input
        interacts with demand to determinant input prices. We will use input market
        theory to analyze institutions and government policies such as the NCAA sports
        cartel, the minimum wage, Social Security, and immigration. Finally, we will
        address the concept of market efficiency and what government can do to promote

        crucial to the process of creating efficient and well-structured solutions
        for computational problems.  To get hands-on experience working with these
        concepts, we will use the Python programming language. The main focus of the
        class will be weekly mini-projects that build upon the mathematical and programming
        principles that are taught in the class. To keep the class fun and engaging,
        many of the projects will involve working with strategy-based games.\n\nIn
        part 2 of this course,  the programming portion of the class will focus on
        concepts such as recursion, assertions, and invariants. The mathematical portion
        of the class will focus on searching, sorting, and recursive data structures.  Upon
        completing this course, you will have a solid foundation in the principles
        of computation and programming.  This will prepare you for the next course
        in the specialization, which will begin to introduce a structured approach

        you’re an entrepreneur at any stage of your journey, or even an aspiring one,
        and you need money to start or grow your business, this course is for you.\n\nWhat?\n\nThis
        course will introduce, and help you put to use in your startup, the five models
        through which your customers can – and will, if you ask them! – fund your
        business. These five time-tested models have been put to use by entrepreneurial
        superstars like Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and more. Sadly,
        though, the five models are rarely talked about and not widely understood.
        Until now!\n\nThe five models will be brought to life by the real-world stories
        of an inspiring collection of incredibly creative entrepreneurs from around
        the world – including successes and failures – through a series of captivating
        no-holds-barred interviews with founders and others, and investors, too.  \n\nWhy?\n\nMore
        than two generations ago, the venture capital community – VC’s, business angels,
        incubators, and others – convinced the entrepreneurial world that writing
        business plans and raising venture capital constituted the twin centerpieces
        of entrepreneurial endeavor. They did so for very good reasons: the sometimes
        astonishing returns they’ve delivered to their investors and the incredibly
        large and valuable companies their ecosystem has created. \n\nBut the vast
        majority of fast growing companies never take any angel or venture funding.
        Are they onto something that most of today’s entrepreneurial ecosystem has
        missed? Indeed, should a business angel or VC be seen as the first port of
        call for getting your nascent entrepreneurial venture off the ground or growing
        it faster? Perhaps not. \n\nHow?\n\nYou’ll be asked to do a series of exercises
        – out in the real world – to put your growing toolkit to use in your business
        or the one you hope to start. Hands-on, practical tools to help your business
        start and thrive – without venture capital. You’ll join our discussion board
        of fellow participants, if you like, and learn from others who are putting
        the tools to work, just as you are. And to suit today’s fast-paced lifestyles,
        we’ve broken what you’ll get – short lessons, interviews, thought-provoking
        questions, even some optional things to read – into bite-sized chunks, so
        you can log in and grab them whenever and wherever you are.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"entrepreneurship"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/72/d9feb0c34f11e5a1806d38aed73fac/shutterstock_261370961.jpg","id":"W9XMEny5EeW3pg6oA-kqJQ","slug":"startup-financing-without-vc","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["26","170"],"name":"How

        Holocaust was an inconceivable historical event, which forever robbed Western
        culture of its innocence. As civilized human beings, we fail to understand
        how events of such horror could have taken place, and how an idea so inhumanly
        warped could have spread like wildfire through an entire continent, instigating
        the systematic annihilation of millions of Jews.\n\nThis free online course
        was produced jointly by Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem – the World Center
        for Holocaust Research. The course tracks the history of the Holocaust and
        has two parts. \"The Holocaust - An Introduction (I): Nazi Germany: Ideology,
        The Jews and the World\" is the first of the two courses and covers the following
        themes in its three weeks:\n\nWeek 1: From Hatred to Core Ideology\nWe will
        try to delve into Nazi ideology and the special place of Jews and Judaism
        in it. We will also discuss how the National Socialist Party converted the
        German Democracy of the Weimar Republic into a totalitarian regime within
        a short period of time, and its meaning for Jews and non-Jewish citizens.\n\nWeek
        2: The World and the Jews in World War II\nWe will try to examine the broader
        contexts of the Holocaust and to place it, as part of World War 2. In this
        meeting we will also refer to the vital Jewish world to be found under various
        Nazi occupations and influences.\n\nWeek 3: The Isolation Abyss - the Perspective
        of the Individual\nWe will try to reveal different aspects of Jewish life
        in the face of the badge of shame, ghettos and segregation, as well as the
        formation of individual, societies’ and leader’s reactions in the face of
        a consistent policy of dispossession and discrimination.\n\nOnce you’ve completed
        this course, you can continue your learning with The Holocaust - An Introduction
        (II): The Final Solution\n\n\nThis online course is offered in an innovative,
        multi-level format, comprising:\n\n* Comprehensive lectures by leading researchers
        from Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem.\n* A wealth of voices and viewpoints
        presented by guest lecturers.\n* Numerous documents, photos, testimonies and
        works of art from the time of the Holocaust.\n* Novel learning experience:
        Crowd sourcing – involving the learners themselves in the act of collecting
        and shaping information, via unique, exciting online assignments.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\nThis
        course is designed for anyone with an interest in the Holocaust, including
        students, teachers, academics and policy-makers.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["110","262"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/fb/9854f0b52511e5af288df91c83e825/_____-__-_______---1.jpg","name":"The

        s’agit d’un MOOC sur la crise internationale sur Ebola partie d’Afrique de
        l’Ouest en 2014 ; d’une durée de 5 semaines, où interviendront plus de 30
        professeurs des universités, chercheurs, responsables politiques, autorités
        sanitaires nationales et internationales, membres d’ONGs, et autres acteurs
        d’Europe et d’Afrique sur plus de 60 séquences vidéos. Les thèmes abordés
        se dérouleront selon une séquence hebdomadaire décrite ci-dessous (section
        « plan du cours »).\\n\\nLe virus Ebola qui a été à l’origine de l’épidémie
        en Afrique de l’Ouest est une souche Zaïre, considérée comme la plus dangereuse.
        Cependant le spectre des tableaux cliniques rencontrés s’est montré très large
        : depuis des formes assez bénignes (pour environ 30% des infections), jusqu’à
        des formes très sévères, presque hors de toute ressources thérapeutiques et
        fréquemment mortelles en une dizaine de jours en moyenne (environ 30%), en
        passant par des formes d’une gravité dépendant de l’infrastructure sanitaire
        responsable de leur prise en charge (c’est-à-dire généralement de bon pronostic
        en cas de bonne prise en charge diagnostique et thérapeutique). Près de 60%
        des contaminations en Afrique avaient comme origine les rites funéraires non
        sécurisés. Les personnels de santé exposés ont également payé un très lourd
        tribut à l’épidémie. Enfin les conséquences non sanitaires, d’ordre social,
        politique et économique de l’épidémie ont été considérables, tant localement,
        que régionalement ou internationalement. Peu de pays ont connu à ce jour d’importants
        développements de chaînes de contaminations, en dehors de la Guinée, du Libéria
        et du Sierra Leone, mais la situation au Mali à la fin novembre 2014 était
        encore source d’incertitude et d’inquiétude. Les modèles mathématiques, s’ils
        ont été d’un apport précieux dans l’éclairage des politiques publiques, ils
        ont aussi participé à une amplification exagérée du problème, notamment lorsqu’ils
        ont livré des prévisions allant au-delà de plusieurs mois, parfois endossées
        par de grandes agences sanitaires, car elles risquent de se révéler fausses
        et décrédibilisantes.\\n\\nNous tenterons de mieux savoir quels espoirs on
        peut avoir de disposer d’un vaccin prochainement, et nous essaierons de comprendre
        pourquoi il aura fallu attendre 38 ans, depuis la découverte du virus Ebola,
        pour que la communauté internationale se décide à chercher et développer un
        vaccin contre ce type de virus que l’on savait hautement pathogène et contagieux.
        La réponse internationale a-t-elle été à la hauteur des enjeux ? L’OMS a-t-elle
        pu mettre en œuvre le Règlement Sanitaire International dans des conditions
        satisfaisantes ? Quelle a été la place des ONG dans le règlement du problème
        ? Toutes ces questions feront l’objet, au cours de ce MOOC, de débats et de
        points de vue interdisciplinaires, parfois contradictoires. De même, l’importance
        de la communication, le rôle des médias, la perception du risque par la population
        et par les décideurs eux-mêmes seront analysés. Une large plage sera réservée
        aux réponses aux questions des participants adressées aux orateurs par le
        forum de discussion, afin de réfléchir comment vaincre ensemble Ebola.\\n\\nPUBLIC

        a fixed capacity, a highly disposable product and high fixed costs, hotels
        are a natural candidate for the application of revenue management. Originally

        essential requirement for today’s hospitality professionals. The purpose of
        this course is to provide a core understanding of the fundamentals of revenue

        матки – папилломавирусы, более половины случаев диабета 2-го типа обусловлено
        последствиями заражения вирусом краснухи и другими вирусами. Вирусы — это

        seven-week course will explore the relationship between law and technology
        with a strong focus on the law of the United States with some comparisons
        to laws around the world, especially in Europe. Tech progress is an important
        source of economic growth and raises broader questions about the human condition,
        including how culture evolves and who controls that evolution. Technology
        also matters in countless other ways as it often establishes the framework
        in which governments interact with their citizens, both in allowing speech
        and blocking it and in establishing exactly what the boundaries are between
        private life and the government.  And technology itself is powerfully shaped
        by the laws that apply in areas as diverse as copyright, antitrust, patents,
        privacy, speech law and the regulation of networks.\\n\\n The course will
        explore seven topics:\\n\\n 1.      Microsoft: The Desktop vs. The Internet.
        We will start with a look at the technology path that led to the first personal
        computer in early 1975, the Altair 8800. That path starts with the vacuum
        tube, moves to transistors, then to integrated circuits and finally to the
        microprocessor. We will look at the early days of software on the personal
        computer and the competition between selling software and open-source approaches
        as well as the problem of software piracy. We will discus the public good
        nature of software. The 1981 launch of the IBM PC revolutionized the personal
        computer market and started the path to Microsoft's powerful position and
        eventual monopoly in that market with the selection of MS-DOS. We then turn
        to four antitrust cases against Microsoft: (1) the 1994 U.S. case relating
        to MS-DOS licensing practices; (2) the U.S. antitrust middleware case over
        Microsoft’s response to Netscape Navigator; (3) the European Union case regarding
        Windows Media Player; and (4) the EU browser case over Internet Explorer.
        These disputes arose at the point of maximal competition between the free-standing
        personal computer and the Internet world that would come after it and we may
        know enough now to assess how these cases influenced that competition.\\n\\n
        2.      Google Emerges (and the World Responds). Google has emerged as one
        of the dominant platforms of the Internet era and that has led to corresponding
        scrutiny by regulators throughout the world. Decisions that Google makes about
        its algorithm can be life altering. Individuals are finding it more difficult
        to put away past mistakes, as Google never forgets, and businesses can find
        that their sales plummet if Google moves them from the first page of search
        results to a later page. With great power comes scrutiny and we will look
        at how government regulators have evaluated how Google has exercised its power.
        Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European Union have undertaken
        substantial investigations of Google’s practices and we will look at both
        of those.\\n\\n 3.      Smartphones. The Internet started on the desktop but
        the Internet is increasingly mobile and people are seemingly tethered to their
        smartphones and tablets. And we have seen an interesting shift in that market
        away from Nokia handsets and the Blackberry to Apple's iPhone and its iOS
        platform and to the Android platform. The legal infrastructure of smartphones
        and tablets is extraordinarily complex. We will start by looking at U.S. spectrum
        policy and the effort to free up 500 megahertz of spectrum. We will look at
        the activities of standard setting organizations, including the IEEE and the
        creation of the 802.11 standard and Wi-Fi (or, if you prefer, wifi), the creation
        of patent pools and the regulation of standard essential patents. We will
        look at the FTC action against Google/Motorola Mobility and Apple's lawsuit
        against Samsung over utility and design patents relating to the iPhone. Finally,
        we will take a brief look at the European Commission's investigation into
        the Android platform.\\n\\n 4.      Nondiscrimination and Network Neutrality.
        Facebook has more than 1 billion users and measure that against a world population
        of roughly 7 billion and a total number of Internet users of roughly 2.5 billion.
        A course on law and technology simply has to grapple with the basic framework
        for regulating the Internet and a key idea there is the notion of network
        neutrality. Nondiscrimination obligations are frequent in regulated network
        industries, but at the same, discrimination can be an important tool of design
        for communication networks. We will start our look at the Internet by looking
        at the great first communications network of the United States, the post office
        and will look in particular at the Post Office Act of 1845.   We will then
        move to modern times and will consider efforts by the U.S. Federal Communications
        Commission to produce sensible and sustainable nondiscrimination conditions
        for the Internet and will touch briefly on comparisons from around the world.\\n\\n
        5.      The Day the Music Died? In many ways, the Internet came first to music
        with the rise of peer-to-peer (p2p) music sharing through Napster and its
        successors. We start with a look into music platform history and the devices
        that brought recorded music into the home: the phonograph and the player piano.
        We turn to radio and the legal regime that puts music on the airwaves, the
        performing rights organizations like ASCAP and BMI. We look at the antitrust
        issues associated with the blanket license. We consider a failed music platform,
        digital audio tape, and the complicated legal regime associated with it, the
        Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. We will consider the copyright issues raised
        by the creation and distribution of music and the litigation over the p2p
        technologies such as Napster and Grokster. The music industry responded to
        p2p technology by adding digital rights management tools to CDs. As music
        distribution switched from physical media to digital distribution, we entered
        the world of Apple and the iPod and iTunes. We consider the DRM issues associated
        with Apple's music platform as seen by Steve Jobs. We conclude by looking
        at emerging subscription services like Spotify and the service that Apple
        is building based on its purchase of Beats.\\n\\n 6.      Video: Listening
        and Watching. Images are some of the most powerful ways in which ideas and
        speech are communicated and video has long been regulated by the state. That
        starts as a communications law issue with government regulation of the radio
        spectrum, but also leads to the design of the television system with the assignment
        of channels and eventually the definition of digital television. And with
        the emergence first of cable TV and subsequently the VCR critical copyright
        roadblocks had to be overcome for new distribution technologies to emerge.
        We will consider the legal engineering that led to the DVD platform, which
        was an exercise in patent pools and trademark creation. We will sort through
        the creation of the digital TV platform and will also look at the copyright
        underpinnings for Netflix. And we will consider the question of technology
        neutrality in the content of the copyright fight over a new video distribution
        entrant, Aereo. Finally, we close the week with a brief look at the incentive
        spectrum auctions and the possible end of broadcast television.\\n\\n 7.      The
        Mediated Book. Gutenberg revolutionized books with his printing press and
        for academics, books are sacred objects. But the printed book is on the run
        and with the rise of the ebook, we are entering a new era, the era of the
        mediated book. This is more than just a change in technology. We will look
        at the issues created by the rise of the ebook, issues about control over
        content and licensing and of the privacy of thought itself. We will also look
        at the legal skirmishes over this space, including the copyright fair use
        litigation over Google Books, the Apple e-book antitrust case. And we will
        look at the Amazon Kindle platform.\",\"domainTypes\":[{\"subdomainId\":\"law\",\"domainId\":\"social-sciences\"},{\"domainId\":\"business\",\"subdomainId\":\"business-strategy\"}],\"primaryLanguages\":[\"en\"],\"partnerIds\":[\"102\"],\"photoUrl\":\"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/de/bced60f7f111e49914553f5bc0e2a1/Internet-Sign.jpg\",\"name\":\"Internet

        opportunity. Technical innovations in networks, sensors and applications,
        coupled with the advent of 'smart machines' have resulted in a huge diversity
        of devices generating all kinds of structured and unstructured data that needs
        to be processed somewhere.  Collecting and understanding that data, combining
        it with other sources of information and putting it to good  use can be achieved
        by using connectivity, analytical and cognitive services now available on
        the cloud, allowing development and deployment of solutions to be achieved
        faster and more efficiently than ever before.\\n\\nThis course is an entry
        level introduction to developing and deploying solutions for the Internet
        of Things. It will focus on capturing data from a trusted device and sending
        the data to a cloud platform where it can be exploited by the many services
        available. You will explore all the steps required to create a basic IoT solution
        using a popular device, the Raspberry Pi, and a trial version of the cloud-based
        IBM Watson IoT Platform. \\n\\nWhat you will learn: \\nQuickly create applications
        that leverage connectivity and analytics as part of an integrated IoT platform.
        \ Use Node-RED, an open-source visual application development environment,
        on both the device and the cloud.  Create a basic IoT solution by leveraging
        pre-built blocks of code that abstracts and speeds the development process.
        Use APIs to access the platform and explore the different connectivity options
        for various devices, gateways and applications. Explore options to ensure
        your solution makes best use of the captured data. \\n \\nWhat technology
        is required to complete the course?  \\nThe programming assignments require
        you to have a Raspberry Pi device - any model of Raspberry Pi with a 40 pin
        header. The course also uses the SenseHAT extension board, whilst it is preferable
        to have a SenseHat there is a simulator provided if you can't get a SenseHAT.\\nYou
        will need internet connectivity to download software, connect to the platform,
        develop and deploy your IoT solution.\\nYour Rasberry Pi will need the latest
        Rasbian Jessie OS. This OS will be on a Micro SD Card. The recommended size
        of the SD card is 8GB but 4GB will do. Note that the learner kit comes with
        a preconfigured SD card.\\nIn order to setup the Micro SD card, you will need
        a computer with either a windows, apple or Linux OS. Since most computer do
        not have a micro SD port, you will need a Micro SD adapter or USB Micro SD
        card adapter. Your computer will also be used when working on the platform.\\nTo
        work on your Raspberry Pi, you will need an HDMI monitor or TV to work as
        the display for the Raspberry Pi (DVI monitor will also work). To connect
        the monitor to the Raspberry Pi you will need an HDMI cable (or a DVI to HDMI
        cable).\\nYour Raspberry Pi needs a way to connect to the internet; either
        an Ethernet cable for connecting to the Router, or a USB WiFi dongle if you
        have wireless connectivity. Note that the Raspberry Pi 3 includes built-in
        WiFi\\nA USB Keyboard and mouse.\\nYour Raspberry Pi will also needs a 5V
        micro USB power supply i(This may be a phone charger for example)\\n\\nWhat
        prerequisite skills are required ?\\nThis is an entry level course, but does
        assume you have basic programming skills. The assignments set use both Python
        and JavaScript programming languages, so some basic skill in these languages
        is required. No previous experience with IBM Bluemix or the IBM Watson IoT
        Platform is required.\\n\\nWhat additional resources do I need for this course?
        \\nThe Server side code for the assignments will use the IBM Bluemix cloud
        platform, so you will need to sign up for a free account on that platform.\\nWhen
        your 30-day trial expires, you can enter a credit card to keep using Bluemix.
        Bluemix has a set amount of free resources available to users who have registered
        with their credit card. If you stay within these free resources limits you
        will not incur any charges. This is a good idea if you are planning to take
        longer than 30 days to complete the course, or if you have an existing trial
        account that that is about to expire and you need longer time on the platform
        to complete the course.\",\"domainTypes\":[{\"domainId\":\"computer-science\",\"subdomainId\":\"software-development\"},{\"subdomainId\":\"machine-learning\",\"domainId\":\"data-science\"}],\"photoUrl\":\"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5b/388f10065c11e6958e7b7f4c6a2563/Watson-IoT-thumbnail.jpg\",\"id\":\"iRl53_BWEeW4_wr--Yv6Aw\",\"slug\":\"developer-iot\",\"specializations\":[],\"primaryLanguages\":[\"en\"],\"partnerIds\":[\"348\"],\"name\":\"A

        muy pragmático y directamente aplicable al día a día de su vida profesional.
        \\n\\nEste curso se compone de los cuatro módulos siguientes:\\n\\n1 - En
        este módulo, empezaremos por la importancia de la fijación de precios, en
        especial, para el resultado neto. Teniendo esto en mente, y tras demostrar
        cómo la fijación de precios es el factor conductor más importante de la rentabilidad,
        cuando termine este módulo podrá llevar a cabo fijaciones de precios basadas
        en clientes, en la competencia y en costes. Asimismo, podrá utilizar los conceptos
        de elasticidad del precio y el precio óptimo al fijar los precios de sus productos
        y servicios. \\n\\n2 - Tras finalizar este módulo, podrá aprovechar los cuatro
        métodos distintos para determinar la disposición a pagar de los clientes.
        Ya se utilicen opciones como datos de mercado o experimentos (basados en observación)
        o encuestas a expertos o clientes (basadas en encuestas), podrá utilizar esta
        información para identificar el precio óptimo.\\n\\n3 - Lo que vemos en el
        mundo real es que las empresas no cobran un mismo precio por todos sus productos,
        sino más bien que fijan precios distintos para productos diferentes con respecto
        a los diversos segmentos de clientes. Tras estudiar las ventajas de la discriminación
        de precios (y el significativo potencial en cuanto a ingresos y beneficios
        que conlleva), podrá entender el tipo de discriminación de precios y la forma
        de implantarlo en sus productos y servicios.\\n\\n4 - En este módulo final,
        hablaremos de la psicología que hay detrás de la fijación de precios. De esta
        forma, podrá «manipular» a los clientes de modo que perciban un valor superior
        en los productos y servicios que produce, o les cueste menos pagar el precio
        de compra de sus productos.  Tendrá a su disposición diversas maneras de maximizar
        sus ventas, ingresos y rentabilidad. También realizaremos un par de experimentos
        con clientes voluntarios para ver cómo el precio afecta en las percepciones,
        y cómo puede beneficiarse de ello.\",\"domainTypes\":[{\"domainId\":\"business\",\"subdomainId\":\"marketing\"}],\"photoUrl\":\"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f3/775d1023f311e6a314494b1e45d0f5/estrategia-de-precios.jpg\",\"id\":\"eQ2a1KTsEeWkKArXiJndEw\",\"slug\":\"estrategia-precios\",\"specializations\":[],\"primaryLanguages\":[\"es\"],\"partnerIds\":[\"61\"],\"name\":\"Estrategia

        are six basic principals that can be used to explain how music can influence
        individual and community health and wellbeing. From biology and neuroscience,

        the difference. Music has always played an integral role in the lives of individuals
        and communities all around the globe.  This course explores the ways that
        music can be used to achieve positive changes with a particular emphasis on
        the most vulnerable persons.  Six different understandings will be explored,
        each with their own set of values and assumptions.  The greatest thinkers
        in each approach believe that their way of explaining the power of music is
        right, but we will show that understanding music in its entirety delivers
        the best results in each unique circumstance.  Once we understand the various
        ways that music can change the world, we can make informed decisions about
        how best to employ its extraordinary power.\\nMusic can influence our bodies,
        rousing us to exercise and supporting us to rehabilitate injured limbs.  Music
        can also motivate our minds by assisting us to rehearse and conquer knowledge
        and skills.  Music also reflects our psyche, providing us with information
        about our inner worlds through the songs that we resonate with or the ways
        that we play.  Music also fosters bonding between people, from infants and
        their parents, to new love and sweet memories when people play ‘our song’.
        \ Music has also been used as a political weapon, with the capacity to protest
        against inequity and to bring people together to advocate for change.  Finally,

        you know econometrics, you are able to translate data into models to make
        forecasts and to support decision making in a wide variety of fields, ranging
        from macroeconomics to finance and marketing. Our course starts with introductory
        lectures on simple and multiple regression, followed by topics of special
        interest to deal with model specification, endogenous variables, binary choice
        data, and time series data.  You learn these key topics in econometrics by
        watching the videos with in-video quizzes and by making post-video training
        exercises. \\n\\n* Do I need prior knowledge?\\nThe course is suitable for
        (advanced undergraduate) students in economics, finance, business, engineering,
        and data analysis, as well as for those who work in these fields. The course
        requires some basics of matrices, probability, and statistics, which are reviewed
        in the Building Blocks module. \\n\\n* What literature can I consult to support
        my studies?\\nYou can follow the MOOC without studying additional sources.
        Further reading of the discussed topics (including the Building Blocks) is
        provided in the textbook that we wrote and on which the MOOC is based: Econometric
        Methods with Applications in Business and Economics, Oxford University Press.
        The connection between the MOOC modules and the book chapters is shown in
        the Course Guide – Further Information – How can I continue my studies.\\n\\n*
        Will there be teaching assistants active to guide me through the course?\\nStaff
        and PhD students of our Econometric Institute will provide guidance in January
        and February of each year. In other periods, we provide only elementary guidance.
        We always advise you to connect with fellow learners of this course to discuss

        warped could have spread like wildfire through an entire continent, instigating
        the systematic annihilation of millions of Jews.\\n\\nThis free online course
        was produced jointly by Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem – the World Center
        for Holocaust Research. This course is the second of the two courses and covers
        three themes in its three weeks:\\n\\nWeek 1: The Final Solution\\nWe’ll look
        at the cultural and mental processes that paved the way to the comprehensive
        and systematic mass murder of Jews in Europe – that is, the Final Solution.
        As part of this hard lesson we will discuss the various characteristics of
        the murder sites and death camps, and reveal selected aspects of the horror
        that occurred in them. \\n\\nWeek 2: Jewish and Non-Jewish Responses to the
        Holocaust\\nWe will try to explore questions regarding knowledge about the
        application of the Final Solution, as well as a variety of responses and annihilation
        of victims, local populations and perpetrators.\\n\\nWeek 3: The End of the
        War\\nWe will dedicate this lesson to the events that occurred in the last
        years of the Holocaust, as well as questions of memory, commemoration and
        future research. \\n\\nWe strongly recommend that you register for \\\"The
        Holocaust - An Introduction (I): Nazi Germany: Ideology, The Jews and the

        features of the philosophy of culture as an explanatory model,\\n\L–to consider
        the formation of philosophic discourse in culture over the period of time.\\n\\nAs
        a result, students will become acquainted with: \\n\L–the core patterns in
        history of the philosophy of culture, their features, and the logic of their
        construction, \L\\n–the basic problems and paradoxes associated with the experience

        will typically involve creating at least one core algorithm for processing
        your data. The model need not be complex or complicated, but it should allow
        you to analyze spatial data for a new output or to create a new analytical
        map of some type.\n\nProduction – Obtain and preprocess data, run it through
        your models or other workflows in order to get your rough data products, and
        begin creating your final map products and/or analysis.\n\nFinal Product/Display

        a growing number of software programs, it seems as if anyone can make a webpage.
        But what if you actually want to understand how the page was created? There
        are great textbooks and online resources for learning web design, but most
        of those resources require some background knowledge. This course is designed
        to help the novice who wants to gain confidence and knowledge. We will explore
        the theory (what actually happens when you click on a link on a webpage?),
        the practical (what do I need to know to make my own page?), and the overlooked
        (I have a page, what do I do now?). Throughout the course there will be a
        strong emphasis on adhering to syntactic standards for validation and semantic
        standards to promote wide accessibility for users with disabilities.  The
        textbook we use is available online, “The Missing Link: An Introduction to
        Web Development and Programming” by Michael Mendez from www.opensuny.org.
        \n\nThis course will appeal to a wide variety of people, but specifically
        those who would like a step-by-step description of the basics. There are no
        prerequisites for this course and it is assumed that students have no prior
        programming skills or IT experience. The course will culminate in a small
        final project that will require the completion of a very simple page with
        links and images. The focus of this course is on the basics, not appearance.

        is the first course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization. Subsequent
        courses focus on the marketable skills of styling the page with CSS3, adding

        you will work on a continuous project, the writing of a professional email/memo.
        At the end of the course,  you will write a clear and concise email/memo.
        The final product will be individualized to your professional endeavors and
        follow the guidelines for one of the common types of emails/memos explained
        in the course: directives, progress reports, incident reports, response to
        inquiries, and meeting minutes. You will gain a wealth of skills. You will
        learn about appropriate email/memo formats, common ways to organize email/memo
        contents, common email/memo routing protocols, and expectations upon writers
        in professional environments.\n\nThis course is designed to be beneficial
        to all levels of learners, whether you have never heard of an email/memo or
        write them every day. Everyone will learn something from this experience.
        In fact, different levels of learners are encouraged in this course so that
        we can all learn from each other. There will be thousands of learners working
        side-by-side on their projects, and the environment will be social, supportive,
        and constructive. \n\nBy the end of this course, learners will be able to:\n-
        write clear and concise emails/memos relative to their professional endeavors\n-
        recognize five different types of emails/memos and their formats\n- analyze
        email/memo context for audience and tone\n- use basic grammar correctly in
        their email/memo writing\n\nMaterials required:\nLearners in this course will
        need only a computer with strong enough Internet to play videos and hear sound.
        A word processing software is suggested, but not required. \n\nTime required:\nThis
        course will require approximately 4 hours of work in the platform, including
        videos, reading, quizzes, and other activities. \nThe course project will
        require approximately 6 hours of work, including the rough draft, draft peer

        business, data and algorithms create economic value when they reduce uncertainty
        about financially important outcomes. This course teaches the concepts and
        mathematical methods behind the most powerful and universal metrics used by
        Data Scientists to evaluate the uncertainty-reduction – or information gain
        - predictive models provide. \n\nWe focus on the two most common types of
        predictive model - binary classification and linear regression - and you will
        learn metrics to quantify for yourself the exact reduction in uncertainty
        each can offer.  These metrics are applicable to any form of model that uses
        new information to improve predictions cast in the form of a known probability
        distribution – the standard way of representing forecasts in data science.
        \n\nIn addition, you will learn proper methodology to avoid common data-analytic
        pitfalls when forecasting – such as being “fooled by randomness” and over-fitting
        “noise” as if it were “signal.” \n\nUniquely among data-analytics offerings,
        this course empowers you to understand and apply quite advanced information
        theory methods – Bayesian Logical Data Analysis - in business practice, without
        needing any calculus or matrix algebra, or any knowledge of Matlab or R or
        software programming. \n\nYou will be able to answer all homework and quiz
        questions either by using basic algebra, or with the special custom Microsoft
        Excel Templates provided. Nor is any prior experience with Excel required;
        we will cover in detail at the beginning everything you need to know about
        using Excel to succeed in the course itself. If you already know Excel, you
        can skip that part. \n\nBe aware that this is not a broad general Excel skills
        course; it focuses on use of Excel to calculate information-related metrics,
        and to solve real business problems, such as developing your own predictive
        analytics model for which credit card applicants a bank should accept and
        which reject as too risky. Real problems are complicated! \n\nPersonally I
        think learning to solve real problems is also a great way to learn Excel.
        We use specific tools in the Excel toolbox to build something useful, and
        you can always go back and learn more tools in the toolbox – more Excel functions
        – if and when you ever need them. \n\nThis course requires some mathematical
        background: you should already know how to solve for an unknown using algebra;
        and have a basic familiarity with sigma (summation) notation; the concept
        of logarithms and working with bases other than base 10 (including base 2,
        and the natural logarithm and base “e”); and probability theory concepts such
        as calculating conditional, product, and joint probabilities. These concepts
        are assumed in the course rather than taught. All the “new” math taught in
        the course is summarized in a downloadable PDF document - \"Mathematical Supplement\"

        hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture, yet still
        represents its summit.\n\nThis course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano
        sonatas from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on
        one sonata and an aspect of Beethoven’s music exemplified by it. (These might
        include: the relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the
        composer; the critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music;
        his mixing of extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often
        surprising ways in which the events of his life influenced his compositional
        process and the character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature
        some analysis and historical background, but its perspective is that of a
        player, not a musicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work
        of the performer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethoven’s
        music itself. \n\nThis season''s Curtis courses are sponsored by Linda Richardson
        in loving memory of her husband, Dr. Paul Richardson. \n\nThe Dolfinger-McMahon

        базовом курсе микроэкономики рассказывается об основных инструментах экономического
        анализа, которые позволяют изучать наиболее важные закономерности в поведении
        людей и фирм. У людей есть предпочтения относительно товаров и бюджетные ограничения,
        у фирм – производственные возможности и спрос на их продукцию со стороны людей.
        В результате взаимодействия людей и фирм складываются рынки, на которых определяется
        цена – важнейший канал передачи информации.\n\nЧтобы информации было больше,
        существуют рынки, на которых продаются и покупаются товары и услуги. Потребитель
        никогда не купит нужный ему товар, если не узнает, где и как его можно купить.
        Производитель не станет его изготавливать, если не будет уверен, что найдется
        покупатель, который его приобретет. Каждый человек и каждая фирма обладает
        какими-то сведениями – прежде всего о себе самом, о своих вкусах, интересах,
        потребностях и возможностях. Однако информации у всех становится во много
        раз больше, когда субъекты начинают взаимодействовать – производят и потребляют,
        продают, покупают и меняются. Поведение людей и фирм на рынках – основной
        предмет изучения в курсе микроэкономики.\n\nThe introductory course in Microeconomics
        describes the basic instruments of economic analysis, which allow us to study

        mining is the missing link between model-based process analysis and data-oriented
        analysis techniques. Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the
        course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze
        and improve processes in a variety of domains.\n\nData science is the profession
        of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in
        a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage
        and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process
        analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process
        analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques)
        and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining.
        Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed
        behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This
        technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any
        type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications
        include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service
        processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers
        using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving
        the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in
        common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence,
        we refer to this as \"data science in action\".\n\nThe course explains the
        key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various
        process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process
        models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that
        use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use
        software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the
        theory in a variety of application domains.\n\nThis course starts with an
        overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision
        making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process
        mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The
        course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.\n\nThe
        course covers the three main types of process mining.\n\nThe first type of
        process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and
        produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example
        is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model
        (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.\n\nThe second type
        of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared
        with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to
        check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.\n\nThe
        third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or
        improve an existing process model using information about the actual process
        recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment
        between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing
        or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process
        model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining
        techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter
        is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance
        at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time
        prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining
        processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.\n\nProcess
        mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process
        management; it also helps to address the classical divide between \"business\"
        and \"IT\". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining
        helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information
        systems development.\n\nThe course uses many examples using real-life event
        logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course,
        one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of
        the Business Process Intelligence field.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"data-analysis","domainId":"data-science"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-essentials"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d7/68f1b0d03511e386f43790e29f1243/dreamstime_l_21055560.jpg","id":"SN5tm_tBEeScRyIAC3-PxA","slug":"process-mining","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["177"],"name":"Process

        \nOver the course, students will be provided with a deep understanding of
        the mechanism underpinning the creation and/or development of a firm and the
        financial support it can get from the financial system through venture capital
        investment.\n\nThe course tries to discover how special financial intermediaries
        (called private equity investors) finance through equity companies belonging
        to different stages of their life-cycle, starting from the very beginning
        (startup and early stage) to a more mature phase (i.e. expansion, mature age,
        etc.) or also staying into crises and decline. \n\nPrivate equity (named venture
        capital when the company is in the first phases of its life cycle) deals with
        very different activities, such as scouting, advisory, deal-making, valuation,
        and financing as financial intermediaries see it. The course also provides
        the opportunity to gain experience with the world of VC investments through

        Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World explores the immense variety of meditation

        underpinnings, their transformations in the modern global world, and we give
        you a chance to reflect upon meditation practices through secular contemplations
        designed just for this course. \n\nWe use a traditional, if overly simplistic,
        way of grouping Buddhist philosophical systems and ritual-contemplative practices
        into “three vehicles”, three programs of theory and practice supporting the
        personal journey from suffering to enlightenment. This scheme became normative
        in India and Tibet: (i) the Lesser Vehicle (Hīnayāna), (ii) the Great Vehicle
        (Mahāyāna), and (iii) the Adamantine Vehicle (Vajrayāna), also referred to
        as “esoteric Buddhism” or “Buddhist tantra”. To this, we will add a fourth
        Vehicle which is explicit in many Tibetan materials, though no standard term
        ever emerged that was accepted by all sectarian traditions - we will thus
        term it as the “Natural Vehicle” or “Post Tantra”. We follow an indigenous
        Tibetan tradition in terms of characterizing each with a specific orientational
        paradigm - repression, refinement, transformation, and natural freedom. These
        twelve meditative traditions constitute the framework for the course’s discussion
        of the main streams of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.\n\nThe five modules of
        the present course, dedicated to \"Lesser Vehicle\" practices and perspectives,
        treat the first five of these twelve types. Each module in turn has four components:
        (i) the specific Buddhist meditation in its traditional presentation and practice;
        (ii) modern scientific research into its efficacy and dynamics, or on practices,
        principles, and processes related to this type of meditation in our analysis;
        (iii) the fact, problems, and opportunities of modern secular adaptations
        in a variety of educational, professional, and personal settings; and (iv)
        secular practices for experimentation, which are either direct adaptations
        or new practices designed to give an experiential sense of some of the principles
        underlying the Buddhist meditative practice.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"philosophy","domainId":"arts-and-humanities"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/88/dca9404aca11e5ab88a912c019e599/buddha.jpg","id":"aaNxjzc9EeWO-Qq6rEZAow","slug":"buddhist-meditation","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["18"],"name":"Tibetan

        often unexpected perspectives in order to judge their success or failure.
        The key objective of the course is to bring into critical focus how we think

        role within a firm, how they take decisions, set priorities and benchmark
        success and failure. \n\nTopics include: the function of the firm; the role
        of incentive; the ways in which narrative forces shape decision making, and

        we can gain insights into what makes people tick within a work context. Increasing
        your understanding of your own behavior and that of your colleagues, teams
        and leaders, is an important first step to bringing positive change to how
        you and your organization work.\n\nThe objective of this course is therefore

        we will understand the concept of motivation and review various perspectives
        that will help you understand how we can motivate others. \n•\tLeadership.
        In this part of the course, we will analyze the concept of leadership and
        consider various perspectives and approaches to help shed light on leadership
        emergence and effectiveness.\n•\tTeamwork. Here we look at team functioning
        and effectiveness. Using the widely used input – process – output model of
        team effectiveness, we consider such topics as team diversity, team processes,
        and team outcomes.\n•\tCulture. Finally, we''ll move to the level of the organization
        and consider the concept of organizational culture, also touching upon the
        concept of national culture. We look at the various ways in which culture

        or to a provided venture concept. From persona, problem scenario, and user
        story development to designing user testing and product launch, you’ll practice
        leading an agile project. You’ll finish the Capstone with a portfolio-building
        design brief that demonstrates your learning and specialized skills in agile
        product management.\n\nThis course is supported by the Batten Institute at

        all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends,
        family, landlords, car sellers and employers, among others. Negotiation is
        also the key to business success. No business can survive without profitable
        contracts. Within a company, negotiation skills can lead to your career advancement.
        \n\nI hope that you will join the hundreds of thousands of learners who have
        made “Successful Negotiation” one of the most popular and highly-rated MOOCs
        worldwide.  In the course, you’ll learn about and practice the four steps
        to a successful negotiation: \n\n   (1) Prepare: Plan Your Negotiation Strategy
        \n\n   (2) Negotiate: Use Key Tactics for Success \n\n   (3) Close: Create
        a Contract \n\n   (4) Perform and Evaluate: The End Game \n\nTo successfully
        complete this course and improve your ability to negotiate, you’ll need to
        do the following: \n\n(1) Watch the short videos (ranging from 5 to 20 minutes).
        The videos are interactive and they include questions to test your understanding
        of negotiation strategy and skills. You can speed up or slow down videos to
        match your preferred pace for listening. Depending on your schedule, you can
        watch the videos over a few weeks or you can binge watch them. A learner who
        binge-watched the course concluded that “It’s as good as Breaking Bad.” Another
        learner compared the course to “House of Cards.”  Both shows contain interesting
        examples of complex negotiations!\n\n(2) Test your negotiation skills by completing
        the negotiation in Module 6. You can negotiate with a local friend or use
        Discussions to find a partner from another part of the world. Your negotiation
        partner will give you feedback on your negotiation skills. To assist you with
        your negotiations, I have developed several free negotiating planning tools
        that are related to the course.  These tools and a free app are available
        at http://negotiationplanner.com/ \n\n(3) Take the final exam. To successfully
        complete the course, you must answer 80% of the questions correctly. The exam
        is a Mastery Exam, which means that you can take it as many times as you want
        until you master the material. \n\nCourse Certificate\nYou have the option
        of earning a Course Certificate.  A Certificate provides formal recognition
        of your achievements in the course and includes the University of Michigan

        changes in the world in the past 30 years is the opening of China to the outside

        as well as the political authority of local leaders in the coastal areas.
        More recently, the world is feeling the effects of a rising China which seeks
        resources and talent from all around the globe and uses its financial wealth
        to strengthen its position in the world. This course tracks the opening of
        China up from 1978 until it joins the WTO, focusing on how the world affected
        China’s internal development. We then look at various aspects of China’s “going

        to Understanding Memory: Explaining the Psychology of Memory through Movies.
        Someone once said that memory is fascinating because sometimes we forget what
        we want to remember, sometimes we remember what we want to forget, and sometimes
        we remember events that never happened or never happened the way we remember
        them. I want to show you how memory works, why it sometimes fails, and what
        we can do to enhance memory function, especially as we get older. Rather than
        covering all aspects of human memory, I will provide an introduction to the
        scientific study of memory by focusing on a select group of topics that hold
        widespread popular appeal. \n\nAll of my lectures will describe what has been
        learned about memory in a nontechnical way for people with no prior background
        in psychology. To facilitate your understanding, I will use clips from numerous
        films to illustrate different aspects of memory. Many of us love watching
        movies because they offer an unparalleled opportunity for entertainment, even
        if entertaining films are not always scientifically accurate. Still, I believe
        that we can learn a lot about memory from popular films, if we watch them
        with an educated eye. \n\nThis course is based on my new book from MIT Press
        - Memory and Movies: What Films Can Teach Us About Memory. While it is not
        required for the course, it can enhance your understanding of memory by providing
        a thorough coverage of the topics that I describe as well as additional fascinating
        aspects of memory covered only in the book. This book is available in either
        hardcopy or ebook form and MIT Press is offering a 30% discount off the cover
        price by using discount code MMAM30 at https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/memory-and-movies.\n\nWelcome
        once more. I am looking forward to showing you what films can teach us about

        statistics is essential to understand research in the social and behavioral

        how to calculate them, but also how to evaluate them. This course will also
        prepare you for the next course in the specialization - the course Inferential
        Statistics. \n\nIn the first part of the course we will discuss methods of
        descriptive statistics. You will learn what cases and variables are and how
        you can compute measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode) and dispersion
        (standard deviation and variance). Next, we discuss how to assess relationships
        between variables, and we introduce the concepts correlation and regression.
        \n\nThe second part of the course is concerned with the basics of probability:
        calculating probabilities, probability distributions and sampling distributions.
        You need to know about these things in order to understand how inferential
        statistics work. \n\nThe third part of the course consists of an introduction
        to methods of inferential statistics - methods that help us decide whether
        the patterns we see in our data are strong enough to draw conclusions about
        the underlying population we are interested in. We will discuss confidence

        world, these organizations run the risk of disappearing or losing their legitimacy,
        steering a sense of pointlessness and absurdity.\n\nThis course develops an
        integrative approach to understanding organizations and their behaviors, termed
        ‘orgology’. It explains that organizations can act strategically to protect
        and renew the sense of membership and attachment of individuals. So doing,
        organizations that survive and thrive impose their logics of action onto society,
        thereby influencing what is legitimate or not.  \n\nIn turn, individuals,
        you, all of us, must reinterpret our multiple associations with organizations
        and contribute to reinforce or inhibit social evolutions. This new way of
        understanding organizations’ relationships with society results in reconsidering
        management and the role of individuals in building their future.\n\nThere
        is no prerequisite to this course, you are all welcome ! Students and people
        interested in the fields of management, sociology, strategy, economics leadership
        etc… will benefit a lot from this course.\n\nFor the session of this course
        starting on January 11th, Professor Rodolphe Durand will actively be participating
        and interacting with learners. He will be offering \"office hours\" sessions
        through google hangouts and answering learner questions from the forums. We

        shaped by the evolutionary forces of natural and sexual selection. Topics
        include resource acquisition; avoiding enemies; mate choice and sexual conflict;
        cues, signals and communication; parental care and social behaviour; and the
        role of genes, environments and learning in regulating behavioural diversity.  We
        draw on examples from across the animal kingdom to illustrate the complex
        mechanisms underlying adaptations, and complement these with natural history
        videos that highlight key concepts. We evaluate the scientific rigour of studies

        on their passion, this course will explore what happens to stories, paintings,
        and films when they become the basis of massively multiplayer online games.  The
        Lord of the Rings trilogy—the novels, films, and video game—are our central
        example of how “remediation” transforms familiar stories as they move across
        media. \n\nThe course is designed as a university-level English literature
        class—a multi-genre, multimedia tour of how literature, film, and games engage
        in the basic human activity of storytelling.  Our journey will enable us to
        learn something about narrative theory, introduce us to some key topics in
        media studies and cover some of the history and theory of video games.  It
        will also take us to some landmarks of romance literature, the neverending
        story that lies behind most fantasy games: J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Fellowship
        of the Ring, a bit of Edmund Spenser’s Faerie Queene, and poems by Keats,
        Tennyson, Browning, and others.\n\nDrawing on centuries of romance narrative

        and economic powerhouse.  It engages the talents of some of our brightest
        writers, artists, composers, computer engineers, game theorists, video producers,
        and marketing professionals, and in 2012, it generated an estimated $64 billion

        the past, Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) were programs used only by audio
        engineers with a highly specific knowledge base, on machines inaccessible
        to most people. But over the past 10-15 years, DAWs and the act of recording
        music have evolved from being a luxury of the few to being available to the
        masses. Ableton Live is one such application. Used by an extremely broad range
        of music creators, Ableton Live not only facilitates the work of engineers,
        producers, and writers in professional, home, and mobile studio settings,
        but it is also a powerful platform for musicians on stage, in the DJ booth,
        and elsewhere.\n\nIn this course, you will explore some of Live’s most powerful
        and useful functionality: MIDI programming, audio recording, warping and processing,
        looping editing, mixing, performing, file management, and troubleshooting.
        Meant to be a springboard for those who are new to Ableton Live and/or DAWs
        in general, this three-week course will provide you with a strong knowledge
        base for using Live to take your musical ideas from conception to final recording.
        The course breaks down the many barriers of entry into music technology and
        encourages all those who wish, to create fearlessly.\n\nNote: If you do not
        own Ableton Live 9, you can download the free, fully featured Ableton Live
        Trial. The trial version will allow you to save and export your work for 30

        course will cover the topics of a full year, two semester General Chemistry
        course.  We will use a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies
        in Chemistry, available via Rice’s Connexions project. \n\nThe fundamental
        concepts in the course will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach
        developed at Rice University.  In this approach, we will develop the concepts
        you need to know from experimental observations and scientific reasoning rather
        than simply telling you the concepts and then asking you to simply memorize
        or apply them.\n\nSo why use this approach? \n\nOne reason is that most of
        us are inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations
        and then generalize from there.  Many of the most significant concepts in
        Chemistry are counter-intuitive.  When we see where those concepts come from,
        we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them. \n\nA second
        reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in
        particular are inductive processes.  This Concept Development approach illustrates
        those reasoning processes.  \n\nA third reason is that this is simply more
        interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles
        to be solved by observation and reasoning.  It is more fun intellectually
        when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers
        to the riddles revealed at the outset.\n\nRecommended Background: \nThe class
        can be taken by someone with no prior experience in chemistry.  However, some
        prior familiarity with the basics of chemistry is desirable as we will cover
        some elements only briefly.  For example, a prior high school chemistry class
        would be helpful.\n\nSuggested Readings:\nReadings will be assigned from the
        on-line textbook “Concept Development Studies in Chemistry”, available via
        Rice’s Connexions project. In addition, we will suggest readings from any
        of the standard textbooks in General Chemistry.  A particularly good free
        on-line resource is Dickerson, Gray, and Haight, \"Chemical Principles, 3rd
        Edition\".  Links to these two texts will be available in the Introduction

        so long ago, it was almost guaranteed that you would die of an infectious
        disease. In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying
        of an infectious disease before you''ve reached the tender age of 5 would
        have been extremely high. \n \nSince then, science has come a long way in
        understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how
        they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis,
        or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases
        are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving.
        Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing
        their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we''ll
        explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.\n\nAfter we’ve covered

        networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends''
        friends, and so on. And of course we’ll be talking about vaccination too.
        We’ll also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing
        are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital

        well working markets accomplish and what their limit are. We end by exploring
        the impact of government intervention on perfect markets. Examples are taken
        from everyday life, from goods and services that we all purchase and use.

        examples  to open your mind to different applications from different industries
        and sectors.\nThe objective is to give you an helicopter overview on what''s
        happening in this field. You will see how the tools presented in the two previous

        concepts, industries, or challenges that are introduced during the videos.\n\nAt
        the end of this course learners will be able to: \n- identify the possible
        applications of business analytics,\n- hence, reflect on the possible solutions

        at facilitating your ability to step back from day-to-day demands and strategically
        focus on gaining a competitive edge on the job market by investigating new
        opportunities for career growth, conducting a thorough audit of your skill-building

        program highlights:\n•\tThe Capstone Project is designed as a virtual training
        and development facility where you will engage in career investigation research,
        self-audit, and creating evidence-based portfolios, professional development

        members) to review their work and receive peer feedback;\n•\tYou may also
        use the Capstone as a “career fitness gym” and work independently on a project
        where you will share your results with others and receive peer feedback. Examples
        of these projects include but are not limited to developing a self-marketing
        plan, creating a new digital artifact, developing communication strategy,
        working on a job application, creating a selection criteria statement, and

        organize yourself, fine tune your self-management information system, provide
        a framework for strategic self-management, and serve as an effective self-coaching

        Exploring Strategic Position, Choice and Action helps in doing that – setting
        a strategic context for planning for, monitoring and controlling projects
        and activities. An on-going set of challenges is found in the evolution of
        International Reporting Standards. \n\nThe second module focuses on some recent
        changes in Standards, identifying the drivers for changes, and examining evolution
        in controversial areas such as leasing and goodwill. \n\nThe third and final
        module, Corporate Governance, examines issues which are causing people to
        re-assess the nature, purpose and scope of corporate governance, and challenges
        to making governance function effectively. Key issues here are the move to
        include a broader range of stakeholders, the perennial challenge of agency
        theory issues, shareholder activism, changing Board structures, and challenges
        to internal control to better manage risk. \n\nThis MOOC will be right for
        you if you are interested in engaging with some of the challenges facing finance
        professionals, even if you are not one yourself. If you are thinking about

        natural philosophers who were active in Ionia in the 6th century BCE and are
        also credited with being the first scientists.  Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximines
        made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while Heraclitus
        insisted that there is an underlying order to the changing world.  Parmenides
        of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later
        Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted
        to answer that objection.  In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the
        importance of the fundamental ethical question—“How shall I live?”—and his
        pupil, Plato, and Plato’s pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical
        systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.  After
        the death of Aristotle, in the Hellenistic period, Epicureans and Stoics developed
        and transformed that earlier tradition.  We will study the major doctrines
        of all these thinkers.  Part I will cover Plato and his predecessors.  Part

        necesario plantear leyes que expliquen su comportamiento, como pueden ser
        las leyes de la gravedad, la propagación del calor, el electromagnetismo,
        la reproducción celular, el crecimiento poblacional, la propagación de las
        enfermedades, la variación de los precios de las acciones en la bolsa de valores,

        leyes se plantean utilizando ecuaciones, algunas muy sencillas, otras no tanto.
        Para poder aplicar estas ecuaciones para resolver problemas, es necesario
        manipularlas  siguiendo ciertas reglas que nos da el álgebra.\n    Piensa
        en el álgebra como la gramática, que nos dice cómo traducir nuestras ideas

        course is designed to provide a basic understanding of financial statements

        financial statements, it is important to recognize that accounting is less
        about counting and more about measuring. “What is it that is being measured?”
        Well, as the course unfolds, you will learn about the three measurement questions
        and how the balance sheet helps to answer the first two of these questions.
        By touring a real company and interviewing real business people, the course
        describes the basic content of financial statements in a simple yet relevant
        context. The goal of the course is to leave a lasting impression about what
        balance sheet consists of and what it reveals. The next course in the Fundamentals
        of Accounting Specialization completes the conversation by addressing the
        remaining measurement question.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course,
        you will be able to:\n•\tDescribe the purpose of a balance sheet.\n•\tDefine
        the three components of a balance sheet.\n•\tRecognize and understand the
        meaning of several items typically presented on a balance sheet. \n•\tExplain

        curso\n\nLos procesos de globalización y europeización respaldan el rápido
        desarrollo de las ciudades en distintas partes del mundo. En el mundo contemporáneo,
        el proceso de urbanización está alcanzando un nuevo pico con el incremento
        de las megalópolis (más de 15 millones de habitantes) como Calcuta, Los Ángeles,
        Daca, El Cairo, Tokio, Nueva York, Shanghái, Ciudad de México. o Seúl. Más
        allá de las metrópolis modernas, los investigadores intentan entender estas
        grandes zonas urbanas con el uso de distintos conceptos, tales como \"posmetrópolis\",
        \"ciudades globales\" y \"ciudades-regiones globales\". La clase estudiará
        debates y modelos de ciencias sociales de ciudades y metrópolis, para así
        analizar y comparar los desarrollos actuales. ¿Cómo podemos estudiar dichas
        ciudades cuando se convierten en megalópolis? ¿El tamaño importa, y para qué?
        ¿Acaso vemos la creación de un mundo urbano extenso o, en cambio, vemos más
        allá de la convergencia aparente de procesos complejos  de globalización comprendidos
        en relación con el capitalismo globalizado? ¿Es posible identificar las diferencias
        escondidas y el fortalecimiento de diversos mundos urbanos? ¿Cómo podemos
        lograr entender este mundo urbano cuando las ciudades no son unidades independientes,
        sino que tienen que compenetrarse en términos de territorio, instalación,
        y asimismo en materia de relaciones como el flujo, la movilidad y la circulación?
        ¿Cuál es la relevancia de los conceptos de las ciencias sociales desarrollados
        en el mundo occidental para poder analizar la transformación de Lagos? ¿Hasta
        qué punto puede el desarrollo sistemático de nuevas formas de comparación
        entre ciudades del norte y del sur cambiar las ciencias sociales y contribuir
        a superar el sesgo hacia la comparación nacional? \nPor el momento, y considerando
        las condiciones actuales del capitalismo, los asuntos políticos, económicos,
        culturales y sociales se convierten cada vez más en asuntos urbanos. En la
        concepción moderna del mundo, caracterizada por el tamaño, la construcción
        de viviendas, la división del trabajo diferenciada y la densidad de interacción,
        existen diferentes concepciones de ciudades que se han entremezclado y, a
        veces, hasta se han enfrentado.  Dichas concepciones resaltan diferentes procesos
        de integración: el aspecto material de la ciudad, muros, plazas, viviendas,
        calles, iluminación, servicios públicos, edificios, desechos e infraestructura
        física; el aspecto cultural de la ciudad en términos de imaginación, diferencias,
        representaciones, ideas, símbolos, arte, textos, sentidos, religión y estética;
        los principios políticos y las políticas en materia de control, poder, gobierno,
        movilización, políticas públicas, bienes, educación; el aspecto social de
        la ciudad considerando los disturbios, las desigualdades étnicas, económicas
        y de género, la vida cotidiana y los movimientos sociales; y el aspecto económico
        de la ciudad: división del trabajo, escalas, producción, consumo, comercio,
        entre otros.\nLos asuntos urbanos clásicos sobre las desigualdades, viviendas,
        gobierno e integración, se relacionan con cuestiones referentes al tejido
        urbano, asuntos de movilidad e instalación, desarrollo sostenible y riesgos,
        creación de ciudades ciborg, problemas de control social y disturbios, cultura
        urbana, innovación y desarrollo económico urbano.  \n\nTodos los vídeos realizados

        course is the first in a series on starting a business. Though new venture
        creation is the focus of the specialization, this course is important for
        everyone. It provides learners with insights to reframe their thinking in
        order to maximize their chances for success. Whether success is defined by
        the performance of their own venture, or by their performance within someone
        else’s venture. The course is as much, if not more about fulfilling one''s
        potential as it is about one starting a business.\n\nSo what can a learner
        expect to gain from this course? At the end of this course a learner:\n     -
        will be able to argue effectively against all of the reasons for not starting
        their business (or reaching some goal);\n     - will be  able to operate effectively
        within the new framework or model for starting a business (or any new endeavor),\n        thus
        increasing their chances for success; and\n     - will be able to make the
        initial business startup decisions of what type of business to start, and
        what type of business \n       owner to be.\n\nIn her classic text, Mindset:
        The New Psychology of Success, Stanford Professor Carol S. Dweck presents
        her research showing that hard work and mindset impact success more than natural
        talent, and that people have the ability to choose which mindset they wish
        to operate from.\n\nDr. Alain Fayolle in the Financial Times defines an Entrepreneurial
        mindset as a specific state of mind which orientates human conduct towards
        entrepreneurial activities and outcomes. Individuals with entrepreneurial
        mindsets are often drawn to opportunities, innovation and new value creation.
        In terms outlined by Dr. Dweck this would be a specialized growth mindset
        as opposed to fixed mindset.\n\nHaving an entrepreneurial mindset is critical
        to being successful as an entrepreneur. An entrepreneurial mindset stands
        alone in terms of its importance. No other attribute, personality, inherent
        entrepreneurial proclivities, training, or demographic profile is common to
        all successful entrepreneurs whether Warren Buffet, Steve Jobs, or the neighborhood
        florist or grocer.\n\nThe course provides learners with an understanding of
        the attributes and perspectives of an entrepreneurial mindset, and the process
        to acquire one. The course introduces concepts that enables a person to start
        a transformative process in the way they think generally, and in the way they
        think about business specifically. This new way of thinking has the potential
        to positively impact not only them, but their family, and community.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"entrepreneurship"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/62/d167a0be5011e58696b71b3e2ddacb/thinking-resized.jpg","id":"JBCvTm03EeWEewoyD2Bc5Q","slug":"entrepreneurial-mindset","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["228"],"name":"Developing

        Resilience and Efficiency are fundamental considerations for city managers
        in managing urban infrastructures. Today, more than 3.9 billion people, making
        up more than 54% of the global population, live in cities. Urbanization is
        expected to continue in the coming years, raising the urban population to
        6.0 billion by 2045. This dramatic increase in urban populations will inevitably
        increase the demand for energy, mobility (transportation), water, and other
        urban services in every city around the world. Without functional governance
        and management structures that ensure efficient, resilient and sustainable
        performance in cities, the current urbanization growth might become a catastrophic
        risk threatening the quality of life of the humanity.\n\nSustainable development
        in 21st century can only be realized by introducing innovations in both management
        and operations of urban infrastructures systems. Developing management practices
        that effectively integrates the processes of urban planning with urban infrastructures
        planning and management is a challenging goal that many cities are struggling
        with  nowadays, but is a must for transforming cities to sustainable and resilient
        engines of growth in both developing and developed economies. \nThis course
        will provide you with the basic principles of urban infrastructure management
        that are fundamental for building prosperous cities that are sustainable,
        resilient and efficient. \n\nIn order to obtain a certificate for this course,
        the participants have to pass four graded quizzes and complete four mandatory
        assignments, plus a final exam. In addition to the graded assignments students
        have the option to write a 7-10 page peer-reviewed case study about management
        of energy OR transportation system in their city (on your own choice). \nThe
        best case studies will be also evaluated by our jury at IGLUS and the authors
        of the 3 best case studies will win a full tuition fee waiver scholarship
        to enroll in the IGLUS professional training program in Spring 2017. \n\nYou

        физики НИЯУ «МИФИ» — Валериан Иванович Гервидс, глубокие знания и огромный
        преподавательский опыт которого делает курс «Физика в опытах. Электричество
        и магнетизм» уникальным.\nКурс состоит из девяти модулей по основным разделам:
        Электрическое поле, Проводники в электрическом поле, Энергия электрического
        поля, Постоянный электрический ток, Магнитное поле, Магнитное поле в веществе,
        Электромагнитная индукция, Квазистационарные токи, Электрический ток в газах.
        В его основе этого курса лежат 64 опыта, в которых объясняются различные физические
        явления.\n\nЗачем изучать этот курс?\n• Физика – наука экспериментальная.
        Лучше один раз увидеть, чем сто раз услышать или прочитать! \n• Именно эксперименты
        позволяют продемонстрировать и легко понять и простые, и сложные аспекты,
        которые традиционно преподаются в виде теоретического материала и математических
        моделей\n• Курс поможет Вам научиться использовать: \n   o эксперимент как
        способ постановки вопроса, \n   o эксперимент как инструмент изучения физического
        явления\n   o эксперимент как  форму ответа на вопрос\n• Очень часто достаточно
        «простые» физические вопросы имеют неожиданные ответы, которые зависят от
        конкретных условий проведения эксперимента. Демонстрация таких опытов и объяснение
        полученных в них результатов могут оказаться чрезвычайно интересными\n• Вы
        сможете увидеть применение изучаемых физических явлений в жизни, в технике
        и в быту\n• Изучая этот курс, вы восполните нехватку времени на экспериментальную,
        «живую» физику, которая ощущается в обычном учебном процесс\n\nЧему учит этот
        курс?\n• Пониманию широкого круга как простых, так и сложных физических явлений
        и процессов по тематике соответствующих разделов\n• Применению физических
        закономерностей для анализа различных физических явлений и процессов \n• Навыкам  использования
        эксперимента\n• Базовым знаниям по физике будущих инженеров и специалистов
        в различных областях деятельности.\n\nДля кого этот курс?\n• Для тех, кто
        изучает физику, и хочет прояснить для себя различные вопросы (в школе, в вузе)\n•

        course is an introduction to the study of bodies in motion as applied to engineering
        systems and structures.  We will study the dynamics of particle motion and
        bodies in rigid planar (2D) motion.  This will consist of both the kinematics
        and kinetics of motion.  Kinematics deals with the geometrical aspects of
        motion describing position, velocity, and acceleration, all as a function
        of time.  Kinetics is the study of forces acting on these bodies and how it
        affects their motion.\n---------------------------\nRecommended Background:\n\nTo
        be successful in the course you will need to have mastered basic engineering
        mechanics concepts and to have successfully completed my courses en titled

        us as we explore India - the fastest growing economy in the world and one
        of the most diverse places on earth. \n\nIndia is an important player in the
        human story and is making a rapid return to centre stage. Learning about India
        has never been more relevant to our lives and possibly our careers.\n\nThis
        course, developed through a grant from the U.S. Department of State’s Passport
        to India initiative, is designed to introduce people of all backgrounds and
        ages to India and its potential as a destination for study, research, work
        and entrepreneurship. \n\nWhatever your interests, this course will help you
        develop a more informed perspective on the importance of India. The sheer
        diversity and scale of India are reasons enough for making India not just
        important but fascinating too.\n\nMany agree that two of the rising trends
        of the coming decades are the re-emergence of Asia and technological change.
        India is at the heart of both trends and shares much in common with the United
        States.\n\nAt the current pace of change, we may see:\n\n•\tWithin 10 years,
        India is likely to overtake China and have the world’s largest population\n•\tIn
        20 years, New Delhi overtaking Tokyo as the world’s largest city\n•\tIn 30
        years, India could overtake China and the US as the world’s largest economy\n\nBy
        the time a current college student is the same age as their parents are today
        – the world will have changed dramatically. India’s importance is growing
        by the day and could very well have far-reaching implications for your life
        and career.\n\nEach week of this interactive course explores one major theme
        related to India’s importance in an interdisciplinary way.\n\nThis course

        heard a lot about genome sequencing and its potential to usher in an era of
        personalized medicine, but what does it mean to sequence a genome?\n\nBiologists
        still cannot read the nucleotides of an entire genome as you would read a
        book from beginning to end. However, they can read short pieces of DNA. In
        this course, we will see how graph theory can be used to assemble genomes
        from these short pieces. We will further learn about brute force algorithms
        and apply them to sequencing mini-proteins called antibiotics. \n\nIn the
        first half of the course, we will see that biologists cannot read the 3 billion
        nucleotides of a human genome as you would read a book from beginning to end.  However,
        they can read shorter fragments of DNA. In this course, we will see how graph
        theory can be used to assemble genomes from these short pieces in what amounts
        to the largest jigsaw puzzle ever put together.\n\nIn the second half of the
        course, we will discuss antibiotics, a topic of great relevance as antimicrobial-resistant
        bacteria like MRSA are on the rise.  You know antibiotics as drugs, but on
        the molecular level they are short mini-proteins that have been engineered
        by bacteria to kill their enemies.  Determining the sequence of amino acids
        making up one of these antibiotics is an important research problem, and one
        that is similar to that of sequencing a genome by assembling tiny fragments
        of DNA.  We will see how brute force algorithms that try every possible solution
        are able to identify naturally occurring antibiotics so that they can be synthesized
        in a lab.\n\nFinally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software
        tools to sequence the genome of a deadly Staphylococcus bacterium that has
        acquired antibiotics resistance.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"life-sciences","subdomainId":"bioinformatics"},{"subdomainId":"algorithms","domainId":"computer-science"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/1f/233340faea11e581064fee4378bb73/assembly_cropped.jpg","id":"V2Rnzt9KEeWVFwqmKx7D2Q","slug":"genome-sequencing","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["53"],"name":"Genome

        Dalai Lama has said that Buddhism and science are deeply compatible and has
        encouraged Western scholars to critically examine both the meditative practice
        and Buddhist ideas about the human mind. A number of scientists and philosophers
        have taken up this challenge. There have been brain scans of meditators and
        philosophical examinations of Buddhist doctrines. There have even been discussions
        of Darwin and the Buddha: Do early Buddhist descriptions of the mind, and
        of the human condition, make particular sense in light of evolutionary psychology?
        \n\nThis course will examine how Buddhism is faring under this scrutiny. Are
        neuroscientists starting to understand how meditation “works”? Would such
        an understanding validate meditation—or might physical explanations of meditation
        undermine the spiritual significance attributed to it? And how are some of

        attention to some highly counterintuitive doctrines: that the self doesn’t
        exist, and that much of perceived reality is in some sense illusory. Do these
        claims, radical as they sound, make a certain kind of sense in light of modern

        du cours est de permettre une compréhension distanciée du dopage. C’est pour
        atteindre cet objectif que le cours s’appuie sur une approche pluridisciplinaire
        qui constitue une opportunité d''observer comment diverses disciplines abordent
        un même objet, selon différents angles et de manière complémentaire. Il s''agit
        également de donner des repères permettant d''appréhender le dopage dans sa
        complexité.\n\nLe dopage dans le sport est une pratique complexe dont la définition
        et l''identification renvoient à la construction sociale et historique de
        normes. \n\nLe cours propose une clarification des processus qui ont conduit
        à l''usage et la prohibition des produits dopants. L''amélioration des performances
        ou les transformations des apparences sont deux aspects du dopage qui dérangent
        alors que pourtant les sociétés vantent les mérites de \"l''amélioration\"
        du corps et que les marchés du \"human enhancement\" prospèrent. Ces apparentes
        contradictions seront analysées en montrant que, au-delà des questions sanitaires,
        le dopage est au croisement de multiples enjeux sociaux, scientifiques ou
        encore juridiques.\n\nPour y faire face, les autorités sportives et étatiques
        ont contribué à la mise en place d’institutions en charge de l''identification
        du dopage, de politiques de prévention, de répression et de recherche. Les
        dispositifs biologiques de contrôle comme le passeport biologique, les dimensions
        juridiques qui fondent la lutte contre le dopage, les organisations de production
        de la performance, comme les dimensions sociologiques du dopage seront abordés

        genome sequence has transformed our understanding of human biology, it isn’t
        just the sequence of your DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are
        some genes activated and others are silenced? How is this controlled? The
        answer is epigenetics.  \n\nEpigenetics has been a hot topic for research
        over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control
        contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are
        heritable through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave
        similarly to mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic
        mutations, epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the
        potential to be manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent
        years that epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for
        example diet), which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.\n\nThis
        course will give an introduction to the fundamentals of epigenetic control.
        We will examine epigenetic phenomena that are manifestations of epigenetic
        control in several organisms, with a focus on mammals. We will examine the
        interplay between epigenetic control and the environment and finally the role
        of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.\n\nAll necessary information will

        live by the attributes of blended learning in this course, encouraging students
        to take quizzes at the beginning of the module to assess their understanding
        and skip material they already know. Overall, we will take a hand-on approach
        and the course will culminate in participants prototyping their own blended
        learning model.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about how to best
        leverage technology in education and rethink the way we run schools, join
        this MOOC and encourage your colleagues to do the same.  Become a part of

        to Quantitative Formal Modeling and Worst-Case Performance Analysis. In this
        course, you will learn about modeling and solving performance problems in
        a fashion popular in theoretical computer science, and generally train your
        abstract thinking skills.   \n\nAfter finishing this course, you have learned
        to think about the behavior of systems in terms of token production and consumption,
        and you are able to formalize this thinking mathematically in terms of prefix
        orders and counting functions. You have learned about Petri-nets, about timing,
        and about scheduling of token consumption/production systems, and for the
        special class of Petri-nets known as single-rate dataflow graphs, you will
        know how to perform a worst-case analysis of basic performance metrics, like
        throughput, latency and buffering.\n\nDisclaimer: As you will notice, there
        is an abundance of small examples in this course, but at first sight there
        are not many industrial size systems being discussed. The reason for this
        is two-fold. Firstly, it is not my intention to teach you performance analysis
        skills up to the level of what you will need in industry. Rather, I would
        like to teach you to think about modeling and performance analysis in general
        and abstract terms, because that is what you will need to do whenever you
        encounter any performance analysis problem in the future. After all, abstract
        thinking is the most revered skill required for any academic-level job in
        any engineering discipline, and if you are able to phrase your problems mathematically,
        it will become easier for you to spot mistakes, to communicate your ideas
        with others, and you have already made a big step towards actually solving
        the problem. Secondly, although dataflow techniques are applicable and being
        used in industry, the subclass of single-rate dataflow is too restrictive
        to be of practical use in large modeling examples. The analysis principles
        of other dataflow techniques, however, are all based on single-rate dataflow.
        So this course is a good primer for any more advanced course on the topic.\n\nThis
        course is part of the university course on Quantitative Evaluation of Embedded
        Systems (QEES) as given in the Embedded Systems master curriculum of the EIT-Digital
        university, and of the Dutch 3TU consortium consisting of TU/e (Eindhoven),
        TUD (Delft) and UT (Twente). The course material is exactly the same as the
        first three weeks of QEES, but the examination of QEES is at a slightly higher
        level of difficulty, which cannot (yet) be obtained in an online course.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"software-development"},{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"electrical-engineering"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["253"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/54/a7d40089e111e5a492a9ec468a6ea2/Titelplaatje.jpg","name":"Quantitative

        to achieve the desired ends.  In this course we will consider the problem
        of how a robot decides what to do to achieve its goals. This problem is often
        referred to as Motion Planning and it has been formulated in various ways
        to model different situations.  You will learn some of the most common approaches
        to addressing this problem including graph-based methods, randomized planners
        and artificial potential fields.  Throughout the course, we will discuss the
        aspects of the problem that make planning challenging.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"mechanical-engineering","domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering"},{"domainId":"math-and-logic","subdomainId":"math-and-logic"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c5/1233807cd911e5a6c6ade9ce238de7/CMP-Logo.png","id":"r8zaNVu-EeW0ugrg2GGh4Q","slug":"robotics-motion-planning","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["6"],"name":"Robotics:

        are traditional stories that have endured over a long time. Some of them have
        to do with events of great importance, such as the founding of a nation. Others
        tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage
        in the face of adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable
        people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of
        all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course
        will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring
        the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and
        nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans
        themselves understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain
        some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular
        culture? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not
        realize it? Or are they just entertaining stories that people like to tell
        over and over? This course will investigate these questions through a variety
        of topics, including the creation of the universe, the relationship between
        gods and mortals, human nature, religion, the family, sex, love, madness,
        and death.\n\nCOURSE SCHEDULE\n \n• Week 1: Introduction \nWelcome to Greek
        and Roman Mythology! This first week we’ll introduce the class, paying attention
        to how the course itself works. We’ll also begin to think about the topic
        at hand: myth! How can we begin to define \"myth\"? How does myth work? What
        have ancient and modern theorists, philosophers, and other thinkers had to
        say about myth? This week we’ll also begin our foray into Homer’s world, with
        an eye to how we can best approach epic poetry.\nReadings: No texts this week,
        but it would be a good idea to get started on next week''s reading to get
        ahead of the game. \nVideo Lectures: 1.1-1.7 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by
        the end of the week.\n \n• Week 2: Becoming a Hero \nIn week 2, we begin our
        intensive study of myth through Homer’s epic poem, the Odyssey. This core
        text not only gives us an exciting story to appreciate on its own merits but
        also offers us a kind of laboratory where we can investigate myth using different
        theoretical approaches. This week we focus on the young Telemachus’ tour as
        he begins to come of age; we also accompany his father Odysseus as he journeys
        homeward after the Trojan War. Along the way, we’ll examine questions of heroism,
        relationships between gods and mortals, family dynamics, and the Homeric values
        of hospitality and resourcefulness.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 1-8 \nVideo
        Lectures: 2.1-2.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n•
        Week 3: Adventures Out and Back \nThis week we’ll follow the exciting peregrinations
        of Odysseus, \"man of twists and turns,\" over sea and land. The hero’s journeys
        abroad and as he re-enters his homeland are fraught with perils. This portion
        of the Odyssey features unforgettable monsters and exotic witches; we also
        follow Odysseus into the Underworld, where he meets shades of comrades and
        relatives. Here we encounter some of the best-known stories to survive from
        all of ancient myth.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 9-16 \nVideo Lectures:
        3.1-3.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 4: Identity
        and Signs \nAs he makes his way closer and closer to re-taking his place on
        Ithaca and with his family, a disguised Odysseus must use all his resources
        to regain his kingdom. We’ll see many examples of reunion as Odysseus carefully
        begins to reveal his identity to various members of his household—his servants,
        his dog, his son, and finally, his wife Penelope—while also scheming against
        those who have usurped his place.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 17-24 \nVideo
        Lectures: 4.1-4.8 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n•
        Week 5: Gods and Humans \nWe will take a close look at the most authoritative
        story on the origin of the cosmos from Greek antiquity: Hesiod’s Theogony.
        Hesiod was generally considered the only poet who could rival Homer. The Theogony,
        or \"birth of the gods,\" tells of an older order of gods, before Zeus, who
        were driven by powerful passions—and strange appetites! This poem presents
        the beginning of the world as a time of fierce struggle and violence as the
        universe begins to take shape, and order, out of chaos.\nReadings: Hesiod,
        Theogony *(the Works and Days is NOT required for the course)* \nVideo Lectures:
        5.1-5.9 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 6: Ritual
        and Religion \nThis week’s readings give us a chance to look closely at Greek
        religion in its various guises. Myth, of course, forms one important aspect
        of religion, but so does ritual. How ancient myths and rituals interact teaches
        us a lot about both of these powerful cultural forms. We will read two of
        the greatest hymns to Olympian deities that tell up-close-and-personal stories
        about the gods while providing intricate descriptions of the rituals they
        like us humans to perform.\nReadings: Homeric Hymn to Apollo; Homeric Hymn
        to Demeter (there are two hymns to each that survive, only the LONGER Hymn
        to Apollo and the LONGER Hymn to Demeter are required for the course) \nVideo
        Lectures: 6.1-6.7\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week
        7: Justice \nWhat counts as a just action, and what counts as an unjust one?
        Who gets to decide? These are trickier questions than some will have us think.
        This unit looks at one of the most famously thorny issues of justice in all
        of the ancient world. In Aeschylus’ Oresteia—the only surviving example of
        tragedy in its original trilogy form—we hear the story of Agamemnon’s return
        home after the Trojan War. Unlike Odysseus’ eventual joyful reunion with his
        wife and children, this hero is betrayed by those he considered closest to
        him. This family''s cycle of revenge, of which this story is but one episode,
        carries questions of justice and competing loyalties well beyond Agamemnon’s
        immediate family, eventually ending up on the Athenian Acropolis itself.\nReadings:
        Aeschylus, Agamemnon; Aeschylus, Eumenides \nVideo Lectures: 7.1-7.10 \nQuiz:
        Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 8: Unstable Selves\nThis
        week we encounter two famous tragedies, both set at Thebes, that center on
        questions of guilt and identity: Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex and Eurpides’ Bacchae.
        Oedipus is confident that he can escape the unthinkable fate that was foretold
        by the Delphic oracle; we watch as he eventually realizes the horror of what
        he has done. With Odysseus, we saw how a great hero can re-build his identity
        after struggles, while Oedipus shows us how our identities can dissolve before
        our very eyes. The myth of Oedipus is one of transgressions—intentional and
        unintentional—and about the limits of human knowledge. In Euripides’ Bacchae,
        the identity of gods and mortals is under scrutiny. Here, Dionysus, the god
        of wine and of tragedy, and also madness, appears as a character on stage.
        Through the dissolution of Pentheus, we see the terrible consequences that
        can occur when a god’s divinity is not properly acknowledged.\nReadings: Sophocles,
        Oedipus Rex; Euripides, Bacchae \nVideo Lectures: 8.1-8.9\nQuiz: Complete
        the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 9: The Roman Hero, Remade \nMoving
        ahead several centuries, we jump into a different part of the Mediterranean
        to let the Romans give us their take on myth. Although many poets tried to
        rewrite Homer for their own times, no one succeeded quite like Vergil. His
        epic poem, the Aeneid, chronicles a powerful re-building of a culture that
        both identifies with and defines itself against previously told myths. In
        contrast to the scarcity of information about Homer, we know a great deal
        about Vergil’s life and historical context, allowing us insight into myth-making
        in action.\nReadings: Vergil, Aeneid, books 1-5 \nVideo Lectures: 9.1-9.10
        \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 10: Roman Myth
        and Ovid''s Metamorphoses \nOur consideration of Vergil’s tale closes with
        his trip to the underworld in book 6. Next, we turn to a more playful Roman
        poet, Ovid, whose genius is apparent in nearly every kind of register. Profound,
        witty, and satiric all at once, Ovid’s powerful re-tellings of many ancient
        myths became the versions that are most familiar to us today. Finally, through
        the lens of the Romans and others who \"remythologize,\" we wrap up the course
        with a retrospective look at myth.\nReadings: Vergil, Aeneid, book 6; Ovid,
        Metamorphoses, books 3, 12, and 13. \nVideo Lectures: 10.1-10.9.\nQuiz: Complete
        the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n\nREADINGS\nThere are no required texts
        for the course, however, Professor Struck will make reference to the following
        texts in the lecture:\n• Greek Tragedies, Volume 1, David Grene and Richmond
        Lattimore, trans. (Chicago)\n• Greek Tragedies, Volume 3, David Grene and
        Richmond Lattimore , trans. (Chicago)\n• Hesiod, Theogony and Works and Days,
        M. L. West, trans. (Oxford)\n• Homeric Hymns, Sarah Ruden, trans. (Hackett)\n•
        Homer, The Odyssey, Robert Fagles, trans. (Penguin) \n• Virgil, The Aeneid,
        Robert Fitzgerald, trans. (Vintage)\n• Ovid, Metamorphoses, David Raeburn,
        trans. (Penguin)\n\nThese translations are a pleasure to work with, whereas
        many of the translations freely available on the internet are not. If you
        do not want to purchase them, they should also be available at many libraries.
        Again, these texts are not required, but they are helpful.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"philosophy","domainId":"arts-and-humanities"},{"domainId":"language-learning","subdomainId":"other-languages"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera.s3.amazonaws.com/topics/mythology/large-icon.png","id":"yqF2L50oEeWJORITtzkPnQ","slug":"mythology","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["6"],"name":"Greek

        the course “Understanding Russians: Contexts of Intercultural Communications\":
        we will:\n\n1)\tBuild skills in the analysis of the intercultural communication
        process using Russian-Western communication as an example. \n2)\tApply the
        knowledge of interrelations between different contexts of communication (cultural,
        institutional, professional, social, interpersonal, etc.) to the cultural
        history and national psychology of Russians.\n\nThe purpose of the course
        is to provide the students with a broad overview of the basic principles governing
        the past, the present and the future interactions between Russia and the West,
        with a focus on the culture and national psychology of Russians and Western
        Europeans.\n\nFor example, we will look at the cases when basic cultural values
        of Russians show up through the linguistic choices shaping language production
        which is consequently misattributed by Western partners. No matter what the
        language of intercultural communication is – Russian, or English – the meaning
        of many linguistic expressions may be reconstructed wrongly by the representatives
        of another culture.\n\nSome of the basic questions we will tackle are:\n\n•\tWhat
        are the concepts of culture that have the strongest influence on communication?\n•\tWhat
        are Russian basic cultural values and how they shape modern Russian consciousness?\n•\tWhat
        are the specific communication patterns of modern Russians, including those
        of public and electronic discourse?\n•\tWhat is important to know about communication
        with Russians in organizational contexts?\n\nImportantly, this course is NOT
        just a list of practical instructions of dos and don’ts of dealing with Russians.
        The course contains a substantial academic component introducing the key notions
        and concepts of the Theory of Communication, which will be extensively introduced
        throughout the first few modules of the course. These theoretical grounds
        will be further on used as a tool for analyzing the intercultural communications

        path for entrepreneurs to grow their companies outside of well-developed entrepreneurial
        ecosystems like Silicon Valley is challenging. Most markets around the world
        do not look like Silicon Valley, and they never will. But there are other
        models to support new businesses. In transitioning markets (where entrepreneurs
        do not have much access to private sector financing), government officials,
        donors, and business leaders are experimenting with creative approaches to
        support the growth of entrepreneurs. Northeast Ohio, whose largest city is
        Cleveland, is one such community. During our time together in this course,
        we will be exploring some of these innovative approaches. \n\nA massive intervention
        of government and donor resources in Northeast Ohio has been in place for
        over ten years. In that time, Northeast Ohio has experienced success (including
        job creation and follow-on funding) with alternative methods of financing
        startups, but it has not been easy. Yes, some progress has been made, but
        whether or not they''ve hit on ultimate success has yet to be determined.
        A dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem takes many years, even decades, to develop.
        Government officials and donors typically are looking for shorter term success
        with their support programs which makes long-term support for entrepreneurship
        challenging. \n\nDuring this course, we will hear from entrepreneurs who have
        launched products and services ranging from medical devices to LED lights
        to whiskey. You will learn how these entrepreneurs engaged with resources
        made available to them through a variety of programs and intermediary organizations.
        We have chosen to talk with many business people that are still in the process
        of developing their companies and whose ultimate success or failure is still
        to be determined. \n\nIn addition to learning about Cleveland''s attempts
        to support entrepreneurship, you will also be hearing in the lectures from
        leaders in selected markets around the world including Greece, Vietnam, Tunisia,
        Argentina, Rwanda and China about how they are working to support the growth
        of start-up companies.\n\nOne of our goals is to learn from you how different
        communities around the world are approaching implementing strategies and methods
        to support businesses. Taking what we''ve learned from our examples in class,
        I will ask you to reflect on how to best grow entrepreneurship where you live.
        I am excited to use this global platform to create a dialogue where information
        flows in multiple directions. \n\nMost MOOCs rebroadcast professors’ lectures,
        but this course will be different. Don’t expect to see me standing in front
        of the camera, talking and lecturing every module. Instead, the lectures will
        be relatively short in length and will have more of the feel of an engaging
        documentary than a static classroom setting.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"entrepreneurship"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["68"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/02/6833219a4722f01632407f5265c508/Beyond-Silcon-Valley-Logo.jpg","name":"Beyond

        modern improvisation and how to go about mastering the different musical and
        mental skills involved. \n\nCourse author Gary Burton codifies a sought-after
        approach to improvisation that has been at the core of Berklee College of
        Music''s curriculum for decades. Students who complete this course will know
        what to practice and how to practice the various aspects of improvising, in
        addition to understanding how the improviser spontaneously communicates to
        the listeners through their musical creations.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"music-and-art"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["21"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/de/4a93f07cc111e5b6970bf60813874a/jazz-large.jpg","name":"Jazz

        explore dramatic changes in the Earth over the last 4 billion years, including
        how the evolution of life on Earth has affected its atmosphere. In addition
        to looking at geology on a global scale, participants will take to their own

        you’ll achieve: \n\nIn this project-centered course*, you will design a series
        bible and write a complete pilot episode for your own unique television or
        web series, be it drama or comedy or something in between. You’ll learn to
        break down the creative process into components, and you’ll discover a structured
        process that allows you to produce a polished and pitch-ready script in just
        a few weeks. Completing this project will increase your confidence in your
        ideas and abilities, and you’ll feel prepared to pitch your first script and
        get started on your next. \n\nThis is a course designed to tap into your creativity
        and is based in \"Active Learning\". Most of the actual learning takes place
        within your own activities - that is, writing! You will learn by doing.\n\n\"Thank
        you so much for your direct way of teaching this course. It was encouraging
        for us all to creatively flow and find our own voice in writing and developing
        our scripts. This aspect was very important to me.\" Ingrid\n\nThe course
        curriculum is simple: you’ll write, revise your work, and share feedback with
        your peers. \n\nI am a proponent of Experiential Learning (active learning).
        My lectures are short (sometimes just two minutes long) and to the point,
        designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a script writer.
        I will guide you but I won’t \"show\" you how to write. I firmly believe that
        the only way to become a writer is to write, write, write.\n\n“David''s lecture
        style for this course is inspired. The videos are succinct and engaging. When
        I watch the lectures I feel David’s sincere desire for me to create something
        truly amazing. He is teaching us how to write a script, and he is providing
        wisdom and tools that will help us do so in a compelling way - by writing;
        not by watching him talk at us.” - A R Adamson\n\nWhat you’ll need to get
        started:\n\nTo begin with, any basic word processor will do. During week two,
        you can choose to download some free scriptwriting software such as Celtx
        or Trelby or you may choose to purchase Final Draft, or you can continue to
        use your word processor and do your own script formatting.\n\nLearner Review:
        \"I am in love with this course. Having never written a script before, or
        any substantive fiction since college (15 years ago) I had a small idea in
        my head that has now exploded into something I really believe in. David''s
        guidance is spot on, he''s his own compelling story teller, he gives you enough,
        and then you have to figure it out, make it happen, WRITE! WRITE! WRITE! \"\n\n*About

        school reform in the United States is characterized by contentious, politicized
        debate. This course explores a set of critical issues in the education and
        educational reform space, with a focus on aspects of the field that have sparked
        controversy and polarized views. We will dig into these debates, situating
        them within the larger history of public education and school reform, and
        considering the viewpoints, the evidence, and translation of issues into educational
        policy. \n \nWe will consider three broad topics in this course:\n1.  Federal
        Strategies in School Reform: How has the federal government legislated and
        incented public school reform? \n2.  School Choice: How does school choice
        aim to improve schools? \n3.  Accountability: What is the history of accountability
        in American public schooling? What are the policies and practices associated
        with accountability? \n\nLearning Goals\nThis course will enable participants
        to:\n1. develop an informed historical perspective about public schooling
        in the United States;\n2. understand the unique contextual elements of the
        American approach to public schooling;\n3. analyze and assess divergent viewpoints

        course offers an introduction into the public economics theory. It does not
        aspire to cover theories of taxation, public expenditures, regulation etc.
        at length and in-depth. Rather, our ambition is to give a bird''s-eye view
        of central themes of public economics and related disciplines, and teach concepts,
        logic, and ideas, rather than methods of analysis, which would require an
        entirely different course format.\n\nOur choice of topics covered by the course
        reflects a trade-off between salience and centrality, on the one hand, and
        suitability for a brief online introductory course, on the other. The course
        content is neither comprehensive (which would be a \"mission impossible\"
        for virtually any public economics course\"), nor representative of other
        such courses. With these limitations and caveats in mind, we encourage our
        students to continue their public economics studies in a more regular fashion,
        and see our role inter alia in motivating interest in such \"continued education\".\n\nThe
        central theme of the course is the role of government as a mechanism of resource
        allocation which complements and augments markets. Governments are viewed
        as public agencies set to correct market failures. Such agencies however are
        prone to failures of their own, and hence markets and governments are two
        imperfect alternatives. We deal with government''s limitations, with particular
        emphasis on those that have to do with informational asymmetry, limited administrative
        capacity, and imperfect accountability to society. Otherwise the course''s
        man themes are economics of taxation, regulation, politics of public economics,
        incentives in government, and government vis-à-vis (civil) society.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"marketing"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["160"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/80/39a038465fe5a012e7a6f0a9dcbb50/Public-Economics.jpg","name":"Public

        How secure are your Bitcoins? How anonymous are Bitcoin users? What determines
        the price of Bitcoins? Can cryptocurrencies be regulated? What might the future
        hold?\n\nAfter this course, you’ll know everything you need to be able to
        separate fact from fiction when reading claims about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
        You’ll have the conceptual foundations you need to engineer secure software
        that interacts with the Bitcoin network. And you’ll be able to integrate ideas
        from Bitcoin in your own projects.\n\nCourse Lecturers:\nArvind Narayanan,

        a human being, we all consume products and/or services all the time. This
        morning you got up and ate your breakfast, e.g., eggs, milk, bread, fresh
        fruits, and the like. After the breakfast, you drove your car to work or school.
        At your office, you used your computer, perhaps equipped with 27” LCD monitor.
        During your break, you drank a cup of coffee and played with your iPhone.
        So on and so forth. You probably take it for granted that you can enjoy all
        of these products. But if you take a closer look at how each of these products
        can be made and eventually delivered to you, you will realize that each one
        of these is no short of miracle. For example, which fruit do you like? Consider
        fresh strawberries. In order for the strawberries to be on your breakfast
        table, there must be numerous functions, activities, transactions, and people
        involved in planting, cultivating, delivering, and consuming strawberries.
        Moreover, all of these functions, activities, transactions, and people are
        connected as an integral chain, through which physical products like strawberries
        themselves and virtual elements such as information and communication flow
        back and forth constantly. By grouping related functions or activities, we
        have a supply chain, comprised of four primary functions such as supplier,
        manufacturer, distributor, and finally consumer. A supply chain is essentially
        a value chain. \n\nFor the society or economy as a whole, the goal is to maximize
        value, i.e., to create satisfactory value without spending too much. In order
        to create the maximum value for the strawberry supply chain, every participant
        in the chain must carry out its function efficiently. In addition, all of
        the members must coordinate with each other effectively in order to ensure
        value maximization. We have to face the same issues for almost all the products
        and services we take for granted in our everyday life, e.g., cars, hamburgers,
        haircuts, surgeries, movies, banks, restaurants, and you name it! \n\nIn this
        course, we want to understand fundamental principles of value creation for
        the consumers or the market. We try to answer questions like how the product
        or service is made, how the value-creating activities or functions are coordinated,
        who should play what leadership roles in realizing all these, and so on. As
        our course title hints, we approach all of these issues from a learning perspective,
        which is dynamic in nature and emphasizes long-term capability building rather
        than short-term symptomatic problem solving.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-strategy"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["178"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ec/e4d760326a11e4b11777b7665ca86d/scm-logo.jpg","name":"Supply

        will start with a design and information literacy perspective, touching on
        what makes a good and bad visualization, and what statistical measures translate
        into in terms of visualizations. The second week will focus on the technology
        used to make visualizations in python, matplotlib, and introduce users to
        best practices when creating basic charts and how to realize design decisions
        in the framework. The third week will describe the gamut of functionality
        available in matplotlib, and demonstrate a variety of basic statistical charts
        helping learners to identify when a particular method is good for a particular
        problem. The course will end with a discussion of other forms of structuring
        and visualizing data.\n\nThis course is number 2 in the Applied Data Science

        in business and non-profit organizations increasingly work across national
        borders and in multi-cultural environments. You may work regularly with customers
        or suppliers abroad, or be part of a globally dispersed cross-functional team,
        or an expatriate manager on an international assignment. You may be a member
        of a global online community, or a development aid worker collaborating with
        an international network of partner organizations. In all of these contexts,
        your effectiveness as a leader depends on how well you understand and are
        able to manage individual and collective behaviors in an intercultural context.
        \n\nIn this course – together with a team of Bocconi expert faculty and Bocconi
        alumni – we’ll explore the theory and practice of international and intercultural
        leadership and organizational behavior. Social science research has revealed
        systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts – enabling
        us to more effectively work across borders. Insights from psychology, neuroscience,
        sociology and anthropology, from communication studies and from management
        scholarship allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision
        making, what enhances or weakens team performance, and how we can build and
        use our social networks. And the shared practical experience of international
        leaders allows us to identify concrete steps to enhancing intercultural leadership
        competence, and to be cognizant of common leadership challenges.\n\nLearning
        about organizational behavior provides a great opportunity to develop your
        leadership skills and to reflect on your own behavioral tendencies. How do
        you usually make important decisions? What motivates you and how do you try
        motivating others? How successfully do you leverage and integrate diverse
        skills and views in a team? Do you prefer professional relationships with
        a close-knit group of trusted colleagues, or with a far-flung network of acquaintances
        from all walks of life?\n\nIf you really want to learn how organizations behave
        and take decisions and at the same time develop leadership skills, then this
        is the course for you.\n\nWe are looking forward to welcoming you and supporting
        you on this journey of learning and discovery. \n\nCOURSE SYLLABUS\nWeek 1

        what motivates the restive Muslim youth from Tunis to Tehran, what political
        positions Islamists from Mali to Chechnya are fighting for, where the seeming
        obsession with Islamic law comes from, where the secularists have vanished
        to, and whether it makes sense to speak of an Islamic state.\n\nSince 2009
        there has been a renewed wave of popular unrest sweeping throughout much of
        the Muslim world. Secular, but generally repressive and inefficient autocracies
        have come under pressure or been swept aside entirely. At the same, the various
        Islamic Republics have not fared much better, but been convulsed by internal
        unrest, economic and social decline. Throughout the Muslim lands, existing
        constitutional arrangements are being challenged, often very violently.\nThis
        course is a survey of the constitutional ideas and institutions that have
        developed since the mid 19th century throughout predominantly Muslim countries,
        but its focus will lie on the actors that have dominated this discourse and
        shaped its outcomes. We will look at the large body of classical writings
        on the Islamic state only in so far as it is necessary to understand the contemporary
        debate, but concentrate on the legal and political developments of the 20th
        and 21st centuries.\n\nThree common themes will characterise the course: \n\nWe
        privilege the study of the legal and social reality and seek to highlight
        where it is at odds with dogmatic stipulations, be they religious or constitutional. \n\nWe
        seek to illustrate the practical tensions posed by limited administrative
        capabilities and political legitimacy that resulted from the incomplete reception
        of modern bureaucratic statehood. \n\nWe seek to examine how popular dissatisfaction
        with the practical performance of Muslim governments has fuelled demands for
        greater accountability under the guise of cultural authenticity. \n\nUltimately,
        the course aims to equip participants to better understand Muslim contemporary
        discourse about the res publica, better contextualise the demands for religious
        law in public life, and to better ascertain the theoretical and practical
        feasibility of postulated religious alternatives to the still-dominant secular
        model of governance.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"law","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["63"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/66/9d5e308eb020f72db558021530c4d6/muslim_democracy.jpg","name":"Constitutional

        курса - заложить у наших слушателей основы экономической грамотности, \"экономического
        образа мышления\" и показать, как экономические знания могут применяться в
        реальной жизни.\n\nКурс спроектирован так, чтобы быть интуитивно понятным

        теории, поэтому он не требует предварительной подготовки. Надеюсь, что изложение
        материала получилось максимально живым и неформальным.\n\nКурс включает важнейшие
        и наиболее связанные с повседневной жизнью темы из двух разделов экономической
        теории, микроэкономики и макроэкономики. Микроэкономика изучает поведение
        отдельных элементов экономической системы страны - прежде всего, потребителей
        и производителей - то, как они делают свой выбор (что купить/произвести) и
        как взаимодействуют друг с другом. Ключевые категории микроэкономического
        анализа, с которыми мы познакомимся: спрос и предложение; производство, издержки
        и прибыль; рыночные структуры (такие, как совершенная конкуренция, монополия
        и олигополия). Макроэкономика изучает экономическую систему страны как единое
        целое и проблемы, общие для всей экономики. Ключевые категории макроэкономического
        анализа, с которыми мы познакомимся: ВВП, инфляция и безработица; экономический
        рост и деловой цикл; государственная макроэкономическая политика.\n\nДля успешного
        завершения курса необходимо получить проходной балл по ВСЕМ оцениваемым заданиям
        (не менее 80% от максимального балла за задание). При этом каждое задание

        the design of larger applications. You''ll get to know important new functional
        programming concepts, from lazy evaluation to structuring your libraries using
        monads. We''ll work on larger and more involved examples, from state space
        exploration to random testing to discrete circuit simulators. You’ll also
        learn some best practices on how to write good Scala code in the real world.\n\nSeveral
        parts of this course deal with the question how functional programming interacts
        with mutable state. We will explore the consequences of combining functions

        goal of hiring managers is not just to hire people who need a job. It’s to
        hire people who believe in their organization, its mission and the work that’s
        involved in the job position. Every hiring manager knows: Hire people to do
        a job and they’ll work for your money. Hire people who believe in the work
        and they’ll work for their passion.\n\nAnd this is not a case of “fake it
        until you make it.” You have to be genuine about your belief in an organization
        and its mission. That means you have to have researched the industry, the
        company, and the position – and be able to show how your goals in life align
        with the company’s mission. Having done so will shape the impression you convey
        as a candidate, the way you answer traditional questions, and the way you
        demonstrate that you’re the right candidate for the job.\n\nThis course is
        the second in a five-course specialization. We recommend that courses #1,
        #2 and #3 be taken in sequence. Course #4 - on resume and cover letter writing
        - can be taken in any sequence, while course #5 is the capstone for the specialization
        as a whole.\n\nThis course can be thought of as \"Interviewing I\", while
        course #3 is \"Interviewing II.\"  Course #3 covers more advanced interview
        formats, including behavioral and situational interviews - along with the
        special case of telephone screenings.  The logic for including telephone screenings
        - which happen at the start of the interview process - late in this specialization
        on interviewing is that those screenings, while happening early in the process,
        involve all the skills that you''ll learn from course #1 through course #3.\n\nAs
        for this course, it will teach you how to:\n\n1.\tDo thorough research on
        a company of your choice.\n\n2.     Prepare for those critical first 3-5 minutes
        of an interview (when many recruiters say an interview is either won or lost).\n\n3.     Prepare
        for the all important \"Tell Me About Yourself\" question.\n\n4.     Prepare
        for traditional interview questions.\n\n5.     Use strategies for handling
        the salary question.  We don''t teach you salary negotiation techniques, but
        we do teach you  how to avoid putting yourself in a weak negotiation position.\n\n6.\tPrepare
        an elevator speech - all three variations.\n\n7.\tUse persuasive speech techniques
        to present professional accomplishments and qualifications in a manner that

        DESCRIPTION\nThis course provides an introduction to the most powerful engineering
        principles you will ever learn - Thermodynamics: the science of transferring
        energy from one place or form to another place or form. We will introduce
        the tools you need to analyze energy systems from solar panels, to engines,
        to insulated coffee mugs. More specifically, we will cover the topics of mass
        and energy conservation principles; first law analysis of control mass and
        control volume systems; properties and behavior of pure substances; and applications
        to thermodynamic systems operating at steady state conditions.\n\nCOURSE FORMAT\nThe
        class consists of lecture videos, which average 8 to 12 minutes in length.
        The videos include integrated In-Video Quiz questions. There are also quizzes
        at the end of each section, which include problems to practice your analytical
        skills that are not part of video lectures. There are no exams.\n\nGRADING
        POLICY\nEach question is worth 1 point. A correct answer is worth +1 point.
        An incorrect answer is worth 0 points. There is no partial credit. You can
        attempt each quiz up to three times every 8 hours, with an unlimited number
        of total attempts. The number of questions that need to be answered correctly
        to pass are displayed at the beginning of each quiz. Following the Mastery
        Learning model, students must pass all 8 practice quizzes with a score of
        80% or higher in order to complete the course.\n\nESTIMATED WORKLOAD\nIf you
        follow the suggested deadlines, lectures and quizzes will each take approximately
        ~3 hours per week each, for a total of ~6 hours per week. \n\nTARGET AUDIENCE\nBasic
        undergraduate engineering or science student.\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n-
        What are the prerequisites for taking this course? \n     An introductory
        background (high school or first year college level) in chemistry, physics,
        and calculus will help you be successful in this class.\n-What will this class
        prepare me for in the academic world? \n     Thermodynamics is a prerequisite
        for many follow-on courses, like heat transfer, internal combustion engines,
        propulsion, and gas dynamics, to name a few.\n-What will this class prepare
        me for in the real world? \n     Energy is one of the top challenges we face
        as a global society. Energy demands are deeply tied to the other major challenges
        of clean water, health, food resources, and poverty. Understanding how energy
        systems work is key to understanding how to meet all these needs around the
        world. Because energy demands are only increasing, this course also provides
        the foundation for many rewarding professional careers.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"mechanical-engineering","domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering"},{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"environmental-science-and-sustainability"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["3"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b4/ab6f50003c2033b621b52827259308/bigstockphoto_Gas_Energy_Flames_209173_EDIT.jpg","name":"Introduction

        six-week long Capstone course of the Data Mining Specialization will allow
        you to apply the learned algorithms and techniques for data mining from the
        previous courses in the Specialization, including Pattern Discovery, Clustering,
        Text Retrieval, Text Mining, and Visualization, to solve interesting real-world
        data mining challenges. Specifically, you will work on a restaurant review
        data set from Yelp and use all the knowledge and skills you’ve learned from
        the previous courses to mine this data set to discover interesting and useful
        knowledge. The design of the Capstone emphasizes: 1) simulating the workflow
        of a data miner in a real job setting; 2) integrating different mining techniques
        covered in multiple individual courses; 3) experimenting with different ways
        to solve a problem to deepen your understanding of techniques; and 4) allowing
        you to propose and explore your own ideas creatively. \n\nThe goal of the
        Capstone project is to analyze and mine a large Yelp review data set to discover
        useful knowledge to help people make decisions in dining. The project will
        include the following outputs: \n\n1. Opinion visualization: explore and visualize
        the review content to understand what people have said in those reviews.\n2.
        Cuisine map construction: mine the data set to understand the landscape of
        different types of cuisines and their similarities.\n3. Discovery of popular
        dishes for a cuisine: mine the data set to discover the common/popular dishes
        of a particular cuisine.\n4. Recommendation of restaurants to help people
        decide where to dine: mine the data set to rank restaurants for a specific
        dish and predict the hygiene condition of a restaurant.\n\nFrom the perspective
        of users, a cuisine map can help them understand what cuisines are there and
        see the big picture of all kinds of cuisines and their relations. Once they
        decide what cuisine to try, they would be interested in knowing what the popular
        dishes of that cuisine are and decide what dishes to have. Finally, they will
        need to choose a restaurant. Thus, recommending restaurants based on a particular
        dish would be useful. Moreover, predicting the hygiene condition of a restaurant
        would also be helpful. \n\nBy working on these tasks, you will gain experience
        with a typical workflow in data mining that includes data preprocessing, data
        exploration, data analysis, improvement of analysis methods, and presentation
        of results. You will have an opportunity to combine multiple algorithms from
        different courses to complete a relatively complicated mining task and experiment
        with different ways to solve a problem to understand the best way to solve
        it. We will suggest specific approaches, but you are highly encouraged to
        explore your own ideas since open exploration is, by design, a goal of the
        Capstone. \n\nYou are required to submit a brief report for each of the tasks
        for peer grading. A final consolidated report is also required, which will
        be peer-graded, and the top 20 reports, as evaluated by peer review, will
        also be judged by an Industry Expert Committee who will select 10 of the reports
        as the Best Capstone Projects. The Industry Expert Committee is composed of
        multiple relevant industry experts representing different companies.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"data-analysis","domainId":"data-science"},{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"software-development"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/de/4dbe30ff5811e58319afc42ddc386b/DataMiningCapstone_logo-_1_.png","id":"TISsePHrEeWDTRLZKqoZew","slug":"data-mining-project","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["17"],"name":"Data

        programming language features that control the flow of execution through an
        app (such as Java’s various looping constructs and conditional statements),
        enable access to structured data (such as Java''s built-in arrays and common
        classes in the Java Collections Framework, such as ArrayList and HashMap),
        group related operations and data into classes and interfaces (such as Java''s
        primitive and user-defined types, fields, methods, generic parameters, and
        exceptions), customize the behavior of existing classes via inheritance and
        polymorphism (such as subclassing and overriding virtual methods). Learners
        will apply these Java features in the context of core Android components (such
        as Activities and basic UI elements) by applying common tools (such as Android
        Studio) needed to develop Java programs and useful Android apps.  \n\nLearners
        will work on several hands-on projects throughout the MOOC, i.e., each week
        will require learners to write solutions to programming assignments that reinforce

        as it unfolded in the United States, from the days before rock (pre-1955)
        to the end of the 1960s. This course covers the music of Elvis Presley, Chuck
        Berry, Phil Spector, Bob Dylan, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix,
        Cream, and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and
        on the music itself. We will also explore how developments in the music business
        and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed. \n\nRock
        emerged in the mid 1950s as a blending of mainstream pop, rhythm and blues,
        and country and western--styles that previously had remained relatively separate.
        This new style became the music of the emerging youth culture and was often
        associated with teen rebellion. We will follow the story of how this rowdy
        first wave of rock and roll (1955-59) was tamed in the early 60s but came
        roaring back with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and then went psychedelic

        thought has always attracted human imagination. In this course we will introduce
        you to the Middle Ages through a wide conception of magic. Students will have
        an approach to medieval culture, beliefs and practices from the perspective
        of History and History of Science. Popular magic, as well as learned magic
        (alchemy, geomancy and necromancy) will be addressed. Moreover, we will also
        deal with how eastern practices and texts influenced western culture. In July
        2016, the course will contain a brand-new module devoted to astrology. Magic
        in the Middle Ages offers a captivating overview of medieval society and promotes
        reflection about certain stereotypes associated with this period.\n\nAt the
        end of the course, the students:\n\na) will have overcome the usual prejudices

        We will analyze what the EU is doing for YOU regardless of where you live.
        We will also look at what YOU can do for and in Europe.\n\nWhether you are
        traveling, eating, working, doing business, shopping, surfing the Internet
        or breathing, all these activities are largely shaped by the EU.  As a result
        no global citizen, business leader, lawmaker, lobbyist or student can effectively
        operate in Europe or in the world without a solid understanding of this unique
        laboratory of integration. \n\nWhile the EU is often depicted as a monstrous
        bureaucratic creature, condemned to irrelevance by the emerging economies,
        in 50 years it accomplished what other countries took centuries to realize.
        The EU remains the most accomplished experiment of economic, social and political
        integration in human history.\n\nGiven its inherent complexities, this Course
        aims at empowering you on what Europe can offer and will enable you to discover
        jobs and opportunities you were not aware of. Indeed, throughout the whole
        course, participants will be confronted with real-life examples of EU action.
        EU affairs professionals will share their personal EU experiences and tell
        us about their EU jobs. You will also be able to interact with the instructor
        and other participants, share your opinions, question the instructor’s assumptions
        and hence shape the course’s content.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/19/4073d0a57111e58b7829d2abc9fe56/UnderstandingEurope_logoCarre1200.png","id":"hSFk2864EeS_ZiIACzuJog","slug":"europe","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["161"],"name":"Understanding

        course ''Unethical decision making in organizations : A seminar on the dark
        side of the force'' will teach you how strong organizational contexts push
        good people towards unethical decisions. You will also learn how to protect
        yourself and your organization against such forces lurking in the dark.\n\nAbout
        the Course\n\nThis course teaches how narrow frames and strong contexts can
        push good people towards unethical decisions and how they can protect themselves
        and their organization against ethical blindness.\n\nThe goal of this course
        is to empower the participants to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal
        behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It draws from various
        disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature,
        in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding
        of unethical behavior. The course also analyzes some of the most prominent
        organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these
        disciplines.\n\nWhenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe
        that unethical or illegal behaviour in organizations is driven by character
        deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently, we simply assume that
        bad things are done by bad people. However, numerous corporate scandals have
        demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the
        rules if they are put into a strong context.\n\nA better understanding of
        why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will
        enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations
        against the potentially overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable
        us to cure societies from problems like corruption.\n\nAt the end of the course,
        you are able to:\n\n1.    Explain the impact of social context on individual
        decision making using various theories (from Management, Sociology, Psychology,
        and Philosophy) \n2.    Apply these theories to the analysis of some of the
        most eminent organizational scandals of the recent decades \n3.    Assess
        risks of ethical blindness in your own organizational context \n4.    Design
        interventions to reduce such risks for yourself and your organization \n\n\nRecommended
        Background\n\nNo background expertise is required. The course is open for
        interested layperson as well as experts who work on related topics, be it
        as researchers or practitioners (e.g., compliance managers in corporations).\n\nWhy
        is this course important for me? \n\nCurrently, the understanding of why good
        people make unethical decisions is rather limited, related research is rather
        fragmented, and the management of such problems in organizations is overly
        simplistic, legalistic, and inadequate. Understanding contexts, including
        the dangers of routines, the mindlessness of our daily decisions, and the
        healing power of mindful decision-making routines is of increasing importance.
        In this course, you will learn the latest knowledge and the appropriate tool
        box for dealing with ethical challenges that you will face throughout your
        life!\n\nWhat do I need to follow this course? \n\nWe build bridges between
        various scientific disciplines and will familiarize you with those disciplines
        smoothly. You need no expertise, just come and share your own real-world experiences
        about unethical decisions. After all, we are all experts in making decisions—some
        more ethically, some less ethically—aren’t we?","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"psychology","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ff/079482ccced35e86a8a9ea70e0c0e4/Biz_ethics_Fotolia_49499572.png","id":"A9Yb1uFoEeWLHw5Kc9wFbw","slug":"unethical-decision-making","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["159"],"name":"Unethical

        and data scientists who want to apply statistical knowledge and techniques
        to business contexts. For example, it may be suited to experienced statisticians,
        analysts, engineers who want to move more into a business role, in particular
        in marketing.\n\nYou will find this course exciting and rewarding if you already
        have a background in statistics, can use R or another programming language
        and are familiar with databases and data analysis techniques such as regression,
        classification, and clustering.\nHowever, it contains a number of recitals

        to play more freely with data and explore new features and statistical functions

        today, and for good reasons. Companies are sitting on a treasure trove of

        efficiently. Those companies who develop the skills and hire the right people
        to analyze and exploit that data will have a clear competitive advantage.\n\nIt''s
        especially true in one domain: marketing. About 90% of the data collected
        by companies today are related to customer actions and marketing activities.The
        domain of Marketing Analytics is absolutely huge, and may cover fancy topics
        such as text mining, social network analysis, sentiment analysis, real-time
        bidding, online campaign optimization, and so on.\n\nBut at the heart of marketing
        lie a few basic questions that often remain unanswered: (1) who are my customers,
        (2) which customers should I target and spend most of my marketing budget
        on, and (3) what''s the future value of my customers so I can concentrate
        on those who will be worth the most to the company in the future.\n\nThat''s
        exactly what this course will cover: segmentation is all about understanding
        your customers, scorings models are about targeting the right ones, and customer
        lifetime value is about anticipating their future value. These are the foundations

        course explores the main answers that have been given to this question in
        the modern West. We start with a survey of the major political theories of
        the Enlightenment: Utilitarianism, Marxism, and the social contract tradition.
        In each case we begin with a look of classical formulations, locating them
        in historical context, but then shift to the contemporary debates as they
        relate to politics today.\n\nNext we turn to the rejection of Enlightenment
        political thinking, again exploring both classical and contemporary formulations.
        The last part of the course deals with the nature of, and justifications for,
        democratic politics, and their relations to Enlightenment and Anti-Enlightenment
        political thinking.\n\nIn addition to exploring theoretical differences among
        the various authors discussed, considerable attention is devoted to the practical
        implications of their competing arguments. To this end, we discuss a variety
        of concrete problems, including debates about economic inequality, affirmative
        action and the distribution of health care, the limits of state power in the

        natural philosophers who were active in Ionia in the 6th century BCE and are

        made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while Heraclitus

        of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later
        Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted
        to answer that objection.  In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the
        importance of the fundamental ethical question—“How shall I live?”—and his
        pupil, Plato, and Plato’s pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical
        systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.  After
        the death of Aristotle, in the Hellenistic period, Epicureans and Stoics developed
        and transformed that earlier tradition.  We will study the major doctrines

        can we use computers to create expressive, compelling music? And how can we
        write computer software to help us create and organize sounds in new ways?
        This course provides a hands-on introduction to the field of music technology
        as both a creative musical practice and an interdisciplinary technical research
        pursuit. Students will be able to compose music in digital audio workstation
        software using both audio and symbolic representations; to write code to algorithmically
        generate music, analyze sound, and design sound; and to describe the essential
        theory and history behind these activities as well as their connection to
        cutting-edge computer music research. Through the exploration of topics such
        as acoustics, psychoacoustics, digital sound, digital signal processing, audio
        synthesis, spectral analysis, algorithmic composition, and music information
        retrieval, we will explore the deep relationships between art and science,
        between theory and practice, and between experimental and popular electronic
        music.\n\nWe will learn about these topics in the context of digital audio
        workstation (DAW) software, the multi-track editing paradigm that has been
        dominant in music production since the 1980s. As we learn about the foundations
        behind such software, we will use this knowledge to more effectively create

        survey data）。常见的流行病学教科书中通常只介绍单纯随机抽样时的样本量计算方法，然后给出“整群抽样时再增加一定数量”的简单原则。而通常统计教学中介绍的统计方法更适用于针对单纯随机抽样获得的数据。本课程通过介绍CSurvey软件包的使用，帮助学生更好地理解复杂抽样调查时样本量计算的通用原则；通过介绍STATA中专门针对复杂调查数据的分析模块，使学生能够了解针对此类数据合理的分析方法。\n《软件包在流行病学研究中的应用》是北京大学医学部流行病与卫生统计学学科研究生的专业必修课。本课程也在同期面向北京大学医学部正常选课的研究生开课，采用翻转课堂的教学模式，选课学生在观看MOOC视频、自学相关资源和完成练习后，还需参与教室内的答疑互动。","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"medicine-and-healthcare","domainId":"life-sciences"},{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"software-development"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/6c/24e6a0154211e4a6dbdbc226e96545/2014-07-26-_______________.jpg","id":"6KkgqfVDEeW_Hgpfrb6ZNQ","slug":"epiapps","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["zh-CN"],"partnerIds":["163"],"name":"软件包在流行病学研究中的应用

        con más propiedad, con un ‘estilo’ de mayor calidad argumentada lingüísticamente.
        \nY, ante un texto propio, suscitar la preocupación sobre cómo decir mejor

        el centeno», versiones españolas de 1978 y de 2007; y «El cazador oculto»,
        versiones argentinas de 1961 y de 1998). \n\nEstos dos últimos objetivos tiene
        más valor por dos motivos: \n•\tLos textos de observación cumplen, sin duda,
        una condición esencial en el análisis y evaluación empírica lingüística: la
        condición de la ‘paráfrasis’: real (con diferencias de estilo, en los textos

        o bien peninsular, en las versiones de Salinger), que dicen, o pretenden decir
        lo dicho en el texto fuente.\n•\tLas versiones de ‘El guardián…’ / ‘El cazador…’,
        desde distintos asuntos permiten referirse a las variaciones de lengua según
        los diferentes momentos de la versión o según la variedad territorial de lengua.

        systems have changed the way people find products, information, and even other
        people. They study patterns of behavior to know what someone will prefer from
        among a collection of things he has never experienced. The technology behind
        recommender systems has evolved over the past 20 years into a rich collection
        of tools that enable the practitioner or researcher to develop effective recommenders.

        – интересно – просто – понятно!\nДанный курс представляет собой серию физических
        опытов, наглядно демонстрирующих работу основных законов механики. Демонстрацию

        \n\nЗачем учить этот курс?\n• Физика – наука экспериментальная. Лучше один
        раз увидеть, чем сто раз услышать или прочитать! \n• Именно эксперименты позволяют
        продемонстрировать и легко понять и простые, и сложные аспекты, которые традиционно
        преподаются в виде теоретического материала и математических моделей\n• Курс
        поможет Вам научиться использовать: \n   o эксперимент как способ постановки
        вопроса, \n   o эксперимент как инструмент изучения физического явления\n   o
        эксперимент как  форму ответа на вопрос\n• Очень часто достаточно «простые»
        физические вопросы имеют неожиданные ответы, которые зависят от конкретных
        условий проведения эксперимента. Демонстрация таких опытов и объяснение полученных
        в них результатов могут оказаться чрезвычайно интересными\n• Вы сможете увидеть
        применение изучаемых физических явлений в жизни, в технике и в быту\n• Изучая
        этот курс, вы восполните нехватку времени на экспериментальную, «живую» физику,
        которая ощущается в обычном учебном процесс\n\nЧему учит этот курс?\n• Пониманию
        широкого круга как простых, так и сложных физических явлений и процессов по
        тематике соответствующих разделов\n• Применению физических закономерностей
        для анализа различных физических явлений и процессов \n• Навыкам  использования
        эксперимента\n• Базовым знаниям по физике будущих инженеров и специалистов
        в различных областях деятельности.\n\nДля кого этот курс?\n• Для тех, кто
        изучает физику, и хочет прояснить для себя различные вопросы (в школе, в вузе)\n•
        Для тех, кто преподает физику (в школе, в вузе)\n• Для тех, кто использует
        физику в своем рабочем процессе (инженеры, программисты и т.д.)\n• Для тех,

        course you will position your own leadership style and grow your resilience\n\nIn
        this course, second course of the \"Inspirational Leadership\" Specialization,
        you will discover the characteristics of charismatic leadership. \nYou’ll
        personally learn how to embody these traits through the “Savoir-Relier” (art
        of connecting and leading with sense) methodology, which covers 3Gs: being
        Genuine, Generous, and Generative. \nYou will then choose which style of leadership
        best fits you, why and when so you can adapt to more complex and difficult
        situations with resilience. \nIn a “Self-Portrait” and “Conversation” with
        your classmates, you will be able to adjust your own ideas about your leadership
        styles and strengths, allowing you to increase your self-awareness, improve
        your relational intelligence, and prepare you to confront crises and resolve
        conflicts. \nYou will also be better prepared to face difficult situations
        and make better decisions by relying on both your perception and analytical
        skills. All these skills will help you create sense in your team so you can
        lead it better.\n\nThis course is part of a Specialization on Leadership called
        “Inspirational Leadership: Leading with Sense”, so you may want to take the
        course “Building Your Leadership Skills” prior of taking this course.\nAs
        where in course 1 “Building Your Leadership Skills” you have mostly worked
        on your inner-self and on the relation between you and the other, in this
        course you’ll work on the relationship between you and the group, improving
        your leadership skills when interacting in a team. \n\nLeaders from different
        organizations and participants of the HEC Paris Leadership Certificate, the
        program from which this course and specialization is inspired, will share
        with you their insights about what it takes to become a great leader in a
        group or team and what they are able to achieve now that they apply The Savoir-Relier
        methodology.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e6/f85ad0402d11e59764c9cfbf30adcf/vign_mooc2_1200.jpg","id":"mt1WfTaSEeWWBQrVFXqd1w","slug":"leading-sense","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["161"],"name":"Giving

        course will provide learners with an introduction to research data management
        and sharing. After completing this course, learners will understand the diversity
        of data and their management needs across the research data lifecycle, be
        able to identify the components of good data management plans, and be familiar
        with best practices for working with data including the organization, documentation,
        and storage and security of data. Learners will also understand the impetus
        and importance of archiving and sharing data as well as how to assess the
        trustworthiness of repositories. \n\nToday, an increasing number of funding
        agencies, journals, and other stakeholders are requiring data producers to
        share, archive, and plan for the management of their data. In order to respond
        to these requirements, researchers and information professionals will need
        the data management and curation knowledge and skills that support the long-term
        preservation, access, and reuse of data. Effectively managing data can also
        help optimize research outputs, increase the impact of research, and support
        open scientific inquiry. After completing this course, learners will be better
        equipped to manage data throughout the entire research data lifecycle from
        project planning to the end of the project when data ideally are shared and
        made available within a trustworthy repository.\n\nThis course was developed

        de alimentación y bebidas están tan profundamente arraigados en la cultura

        una cuestión de hacer y vender productos buenos y sabrosos, sino hacer productos
        que nutran el cuerpo, el alma y el corazón de las personas. Teniendo en cuenta
        lo anteriormente expuesto, no es difícil ver que la tarea se convierte rápidamente
        compleja.\n\nEste curso tiene un doble objetivo: en primer lugar, vamos a
        centrarnos en los desafíos contemporáneos que los gerentes y empresarios de
        las empresas de alimentos y bebidas deben ser capaces de enfrentar; en segundo
        lugar, vamos a ofrecer modelos y herramientas para planificar e implementar
        procesos apropiados para satisfacer a los clientes y construir una ventaja
        sobre la competencia.\n\nEl curso está compuesto por cuatro módulos y una
        introducción, cada uno explora uno de los dilemas que las empresas de alimentación
        y bebidas se enfrentan. Te será proporcionado un set de video lecciones y
        tendremos oradores invitados. En estas lecciones se hará una introducción
        accesible a temas específicos que será integrada con entrevistas a gerentes
        y expertos que darán ideas valiosas y ejemplos a los participantes.\n\nPara
        mejorar tu experiencia de aprendizaje con nosotros, pondremos a tu disposición
        un documental sobre las excelencias del Distrito de Módena que estará en un

        la oportunidad de experimentar en primera persona lo que los estudiantes de
        nuestro campus experimentan durante los viajes de estudio en las empresas
        italianas y europeas.\n\nA cada módulo le corresponde una prueba y la posibilidad
        de discutir con tus pares en los “discussion forums” que te darán la oportunidad
        de reflexionar sobre la variedad del mundo de alimentación y bebidas, sobre
        su complejidad, y sobre el poder de la red que construiremos juntos durante

        course provides an overview of the issue of postharvest loss of grains by
        exploring essential physical, technical, and social dimensions of postharvest
        supply chains and loss prevention methods globally.\n\nEach year, estimates
        suggest that 1/3 of all food produced is lost or wasted, making postharvest
        loss a critical global food security and sustainability issue of today. Key
        knowledge areas are presented including:\n-An overview of postharvest loss\n-Supply
        chain activities such as harvesting, drying, and storage\n-Economics and markets\n-An
        introduction to the network of actors working in this field\n\nWe face the
        immense challenge of feeding over 9 billion people by the year 2050. To meet
        these demands, yields will have to more than double using the same amount
        of natural resources. In recent years, postharvest loss has been recognized
        by major institutions including the US government, the United Nations, the
        CGIAR Research Consortium, and several others as a significant opportunity
        to impact food security and improve livelihoods. Despite this increased attention,
        a lack of knowledge, technical capacity, and resources remain obstacles for
        stakeholders worldwide to act on these issues. This course will, for the first
        time, provide you as professionals, practitioners, and students, with a comprehensive
        introduction to postharvest loss processes and begin building capacity for
        loss prevention worldwide.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"environmental-science-and-sustainability"},{"subdomainId":"nutrition","domainId":"life-sciences"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/78/ea3df074b411e485319ba978b303cc/postharvestloss.jpg","id":"TmuXRhJWEea8fxLSgUgxeQ","slug":"postharvest","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["17"],"name":"Global

        goods and services are subject to scarcity at some level. Scarcity means that
        society must develop some allocation mechanism – rules to determine who gets
        what. Over recorded history, these allocation rules were usually command based
        – the king or the emperor would decide. In contemporary times, most countries
        have turned to market based allocation systems. In markets, prices act as
        rationing devices, encouraging or discouraging production and encouraging
        or discouraging consumption in such a way as to find an equilibrium allocation
        of resources. We will construct demand curves to capture consumer behavior
        and supply curves to capture producer behavior. The resulting equilibrium
        price “rations” the scarce commodity. Markets are frequent targets of government
        intervention. This intervention can be direct control of prices or it could
        be indirect price pressure through the imposition of taxes or subsidies. Both
        forms of intervention are impacted by elasticity of demand. \n\nAfter this
        course, you will be able to: \n•\tDescribe consumer behavior as captured by
        the demand curve.\n•\tDescribe producer behavior as captured by the supply

        About the Course --\n\nFrom the Nuremberg trial to the case against Saddam
        Hussein, from the prosecution of Al-Qaeda terrorists to the trial of Somali
        pirates – no area of law is as important to world peace and security as international
        criminal law.  Taught by one of the world’s leading experts in the field,
        this course will educate students about the fundamentals of international
        criminal law and policy.  We will explore the contours of international crimes
        such as genocide, war crimes, terrorism, and piracy.  We will examine unique
        modes of international criminal liability and specialized defenses.  And we
        will delve into the challenges of obtaining custody of the accused and maintaining
        control of the courtroom.\n\n-- Course Syllabus --\n\nThis course comprises
        eight units (or \"modules\"). Each will include an assigned reading, typically
        an article or book chapter, as well as a simulation designed to bring the
        readings to life.\n\nI will also offer video lectures on each of the topics,
        accompanied by slides.  In addition, there will be online role-play exercises
        and debates, enabling the students to share their own insights. \n\nThe order
        of class sessions will be:\n\n(1)     History: From Nuremberg to The Hague\n\n(2)     International
        Crimes Part 1: War Crimes, Genocide, Crimes against Humanity, and Torture\n\n(3)     International
        Crimes Part 2: Terrorism and Piracy\n\n(4)     Special modes of liability:
        command responsibility, co-perpetration, and incitement\n\n(5)      Special
        defenses: insanity, obedience to orders, duress, and head of state immunity\n\n(6)      Gaining
        custody of the accused: extradition, luring, abduction, and targeted killing\n\n(7)      Pre-Trial
        Issues: plea bargaining, self-representation, and exclusion of torture evidence\n\n(8)      Maintaining
        control of the courtroom    \n\n-- Recommended Background --\n\nYou don’t
        have to be a lawyer and there are no prerequisites for this course. However,
        the course will be conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduate
        students. Therefore, for all participants, reading and writing comfortably
        in English at the undergraduate college level is desirable. \n\n-- Suggested
        Readings --\n\nStudents should read the assigned online materials for each
        unit in advance of the class session.  \n\nIn addition, students are invited
        to subscribe to “War Crimes Prosecution Watch,” a free bi-weekly e-newsletter
        that summarizes the latest developments in the field of international criminal
        law.\n\n-- Course Format --\n\nThis course is made up of eight content units.
        Each unit is based on an online reading assignment, a video lecture of about
        one hour in length, and one or more role play exercises to stimulate on-line
        discussion. The course also offers in-video enrichment quizzes (ungraded)
        for each unit, a ten question multiple choice midterm diagnostics exam (ungraded),
        and a ten question True/False Final Exam.   \n\n-- FAQ--\n\nHow will this
        course be graded? \n\nThis course is graded on completion. In order to complete
        the course each student must: (1) finish each module (or “lesson”); (2) write
        at least one essay response of 200 words or more for at least one simulation
        throughout the course; and (3) get a score of 6 out of 10 or better on the
        Final Exam.\n\nWhat resources will I need for this course?\n\nFor this course,
        all you need is an Internet connection, and the time to read and discuss the

        forms the basis of modern medicine. Clinical research provides us with this
        evidence, guiding health professionals towards solutions to problems that
        they face in daily practice. Transferring existing problems in medical practice
        to a research setting is a challenging process that requires careful consideration.
        The practice of clinical epidemiology aims to address this through the application
        of established approaches for research in human populations, while at all
        times focussing on the problem at hand from a clinical perspective.\n\nThis
        course teaches the principles and practice of clinical epidemiology, drawing
        on real problems faced by medical professionals and elaborating on existing
        examples of clinical research. Medical researchers will lean how to translate
        real clinical problems into tangible research questions for investigation,
        gaining insight into some of the most important considerations when designing
        an epidemiological study along the way. \n\nCore concepts will be introduced

        can boards do to carry this out effectively? \n\nWeek 2: This week''s questions:
        What is the board''s role in assessing the performance of the organization?
        Why is performance assessment important? Why do many boards have difficulty
        meeting their performance assessment responsibilities? \n\nWeek 3: This week''s
        questions: What are the elements of the fundraising/resource development process?
        What is the board''s role in ensuring the organization has adequate funding?
        What information should be in a resource development plan? \n\nWeek 4: At
        this stage, you are asked to review the course content, submit a written assignment
        (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board Effectiveness Readiness Assessment),

        photographs and comments with peers, and reflecting on their comments about
        your photos, will be an exciting learning experience that will help you grow
        in understanding your own photography and that of others.  Your contribution
        of comments to fellow Learners will not only help them understand their photographs
        better, but it will give you an opportunity to use the vocabulary of terms

        a company in the food and beverage industry is a fascinating task.\n\nFood
        and beverage products are so deeply rooted in the culture of most countries
        that making and selling them is not only a matter of making and selling good
        and tasty products, but products that nurture people''s body, soul, and heart.
        Given this, it''s not difficult to see that the task quickly becomes complex.\n\nThe
        objective of this course is twofold: first, we will focus on contemporary
        challenges that managers and entrepreneurs in food and beverage businesses
        should be able to face; and second, we will provide models and tools to design
        and implement appropriate courses of action to satisfy customers and build
        an advantage over the competition.\n\nThis course is made up of four modules
        and an introduction, each exploring one dilemma that food and beverage companies
        face. You will be presented with a set of video lectures and guest speakers.
        These lectures combine an accessible introduction to specific topics integrated
        with interviews of managers and experts that will give precious insights and
        examples to the participants.\n\nTo enhance your learning experience with
        us, we will make a Documentary on the Excellences of the Modena District available

        as our on-campus students usually do.\n\nEach module is paired with an evaluated
        quiz and weekly discussion forums to reflect on the variety of the F&B world,
        its complexity, and the power of the network that we will build together during
        the course.\n\nSuccessful completion of the quizzes is required for a course

        collection strategies, and basic image processing workflows for all 3 basic
        modalities of modern cryo-EM: tomography, single particle analysis, and 2-D
        crystallography.\n\nPhilosophy:\nThe course emphasizes concepts rather than
        mathematical details, taught through numerous drawings and example images.  It
        is meant for anyone interested in the burgeoning fields of cryo-EM and 3-D
        EM, including cell biologists or molecular biologists without extensive training
        in mathematics or imaging physics and practicing electron microscopists who
        want to broaden their understanding of the field.  The class is perfect as
        a primer for anyone who is about to be trained as a cryo-electron microscopist,
        or for anyone who needs an introduction to the field to be able to understand
        the literature or the talks and conversations they will hear at cryo-EM meetings.\n\nPre-requisites:\nThe

        \nThere are 14.5 hours of lecture videos total separated into 40 individual

        a list of “concept check” questions you can use to test your knowledge of
        what was presented. As the modules are grouped into seven major subjects,
        one reasonable plan would be to go through one major subject each day.  That
        would mean watching a couple hours of lecture and spending another hour or
        so thinking through the concept check questions each day for a week.  Another
        reasonable plan would be to go through one module each day for a little over
        a month, or even three modules a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for
        a 3-month term.\n\nIt is likely that as you then move on to actually begin

        the end of this course learners will be able to:\n   -complete a business
        model summarizing assumptions about what value they will offer to whom, and
        how they will make \n    money.\n   - systematically test and validate these
        assumptions within the constraints of their available resources, and\n   -
        use these validated assumptions to generate financial projections that are
        based on actual resources and efforts expended.\n\nThe days of the 40 page
        business plan have certainly passed, but the role of planning in the business
        creation process is one of extreme importance. In this course we will explore
        the important components that you need to explore in detail prior to business
        creation. Action without planning is a recipe for disaster and we will make
        sure you have a rock solid foundation for future actions.\n\nThe planning
        here is focused on learning. It is unrealistic for anyone to document in detail
        all of the actions they should take to make a new venture or activity successful
        when they (and often no one else) has any experience with the new venture
        and the conditions which it is likely to face. Thus the business plan based
        largely on assumptions and aggregate, non-applicable data is replaced with
        the business model which organizes the key assumptions determining what value
        the business will offer to whom, and how it will make money. The course will
        guide learners through the process of systematically testing and validating
        these assumptions, and obtaining specific, applicable data. It will then show
        learners how to use these validated assumptions to generate pro-forma financial
        statements directly tied to actions and resources based on this business model.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"entrepreneurship"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4b/75d4f0be5111e59c1bb1844bad7ba4/planning-resize.jpg","id":"BySMWm04EeW8nRIpKnwp7Q","slug":"business-planning","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["228"],"name":"Planning:

        is a bacterium that lives symbiotically inside some insects. Its sheltered
        life has allowed it to reduce its genome to only about 160,000 base pairs.
        With only about 200 genes, it lacks some genes necessary for survival, but
        these genes are supplied by its insect host. In fact, Carsonella has such
        a small genome that biologists have conjectured that it is losing its “bacterial”
        identity and turning into an organelle, which is part of the host’s genome.
        This transition from bacterium to organelle has happened many times during
        evolutionary history; in fact, the mitochondrion responsible for energy production
        in human cells was once a free-roaming bacterium that we assimilated in the
        distant past. Given a collection of simulated error-free read-pairs, use the
        paired de Bruijn graph to reconstruct the Carsonella ruddii genome. Compare
        this assembly to the assembly obtained from the classic de Bruijn graph (i.e.,
        when all we know is the reads themselves and do not know the distance between
        paired reads) in order to better appreciate the benefits of read-pairs. For
        each k, what is the minimum value of d needed to enable reconstruction of

        ses premières années est la promesse d’une aventure hors du commun mais ce
        n’est pas un acte anodin : il faut être capable d’accepter que toutes les
        « bonnes » idées ne conduiront pas au succès, que seule une minorité de projets
        débouchera sur un immense succès. Il faut aussi renverser votre rapport à
        l’échec, qui est une source d’expérience et doit être géré selon la logique
        de la « perte acceptable » : l’entrepreneur aime l’incertitude, pas le risque

        We will explore whether and how international criminal justice contribute
        to what UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon called the ‘age of accountability’.
        The theory is, those who commit the worst of human crimes, are held accountable,
        whether they are rank-and-file foot soldiers or military commanders, whether
        they are lowly civil servants following orders or top political leaders. We
        will test  how this can be done and if this is realistic.\n\nDuring this course,
        you will be offered a look into the ‘kitchen’ of the Hague international criminal
        courts and tribunals. You will learn how international criminal justice functions,
        who the actors are, what outcomes it produces, and how it can be improved.
        \n\nIf you want to gain a better understanding of international criminal cases,
        like the Lubanga case, the ICC’s first ever trial, and the legal legacy of
        UN international criminal tribunals, then this course is definitely for you!\n\nThis

        how social factors promote mental health, influence the onset and course of
        mental illness, and affect how mental illnesses are diagnosed and treated.\n\nThis
        course explores how our understanding of mental health and illness has been
        influenced by social attitudes and social developments in North America and
        around the world. The course begins by situating our contemporary mental health
        practices in historical context, then looks at different aspects of mental
        health, mental illness and mental health services and their connections to
        what’s going on in our social environment.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["11"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera.s3.amazonaws.com/topics/mentalhealth/large-icon.png","name":"The

        business school researchers have identified a powerful model for making business
        decisions that is based on economics, law and ethics.  The Three Pillar model
        in this course expands this model by adding strategy in place of economics.  With
        this change, the model becomes a practical framework that you can use to make
        all types of decisions—business, leadership and personal.\n\nThis course uses
        business decision making to show you how to use the model.  In essence, to
        achieve business and career success, you must manage risk (the Law Pillar)
        and create value (the Strategy Pillar) in a responsible manner (the Ethics
        Pillar).\n\nBecause the Law Pillar is especially important and challenging,
        the course provides legal briefings (with many examples) on the key elements
        of business success, such as (1) attracting the best employees, (2) developing
        successful products, (3) creating new business models, (4) protecting intellectual
        property, (5) creating contracts that achieve business goals, and (6) using
        dispute resolution processes that improve business relationships. \n\nIn taking
        a global perspective in covering these elements, the course provides an introduction
        to the global business culture to learners from the United States, and an
        introduction to the US business culture to learners from outside the US. \n\nWith
        this background on the Law Pillar, after completing this course you should
        be able to:\n\n- Manage the key risks you face in business.\n- Create value
        for your business by linking the Law Pillar to the Strategy Pillar.\n- Use
        the Ethics Pillar to become a leader in creating or managing a business that
        serves the interests of society while creating profits for its shareholders.\n\nAfter
        you master the Three Pillar model for business decisions, you can easily apply
        the model to your personal decisions and to leadership decisions in non-business
        settings.\n\nHow to successfully complete this course (4 steps):\n\n(1) Watch
        the short videos for each module.  The videos are interactive and include
        questions to test your understanding of the Three Pillars model.  You can
        watch them week-by-week or you can binge watch them.  Someone who binge-watched
        my first MOOC (“Successful Negotiation:  Essential Strategies and Skills”)
        concluded “It’s as good as ‘Breaking Bad.’”\n\n(2) Do the readings.  The readings
        are short and designed to help you use the Three Pillar model in making everyday
        business decisions.  They reinforce the videos and add additional coverage.
        \n\n(3) “Show what you know” by taking the practice quizzes at the end of
        each module.\n\n(4) Take the final examination.  The exam is a Mastery Exam,
        which means that you can take it as many times as you want until you master
        the material.   \n\nYou have the option of earning a Course Certificate through
        the verification of your identity and successful completion of the course.  A
        Certificate provides formal recognition of your achievements in the course
        and includes the University of Michigan logo.  If you''re considering getting
        a Course Certificate, you should complete the verification process before
        taking the Final Exam. You can choose to pay the associated fee before or
        after the exam.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-essentials"},{"subdomainId":"law","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0f/60c280f1f111e5a06e31881a7e175f/SLE_Thumbnail_TO_031416_FINAL.jpg","id":"3Mf1LkHGEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ","slug":"strategy-law-ethics","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["3"],"name":"The

        is one of the most important but least understood marketing decisions. Learn
        and practice concepts, techniques, and get to grips with the latest thinking
        on assessing and formulating pricing strategies. Analyze how firms attempt
        to capture value, as well as profits, in the revenues they earn. \n\nAfter
        this course, you will be able to contribute to the process of formulating
        pricing strategies for your own products and services, or those of your firm.
        This course has an additional focus on pricing dynamics and the reaction to
        and by competitors, taking a highly pragmatic approach and one that is directly
        applicable to your day-to-day professional life.\n\nThis course is made up
        of the following four modules:\n\n1 - In this module we will start with the
        importance of pricing, especially for the bottom line. Having this in mind,
        and after showing how pricing is the most important driver of profitability,
        when you finish this module you will be able to execute cost, competition
        and customer-based pricing. You will also be able to use the concepts of price
        elasticity and optimal price while setting prices for your products and services.\n\n2
        - After finishing this module you will be able to take advantage of four different
        methods to determine the willingness to pay from customers. Whether using
        Market Data or Experiments (Observation based) or Expert or Customer Surveys
        (Survey based), you''ll be able to use this information in order to identify
        the optimal price.\n\n3 - What we see in the real world is that companies
        don''t only charge one price for all their products, but rather set different
        prices for different products with respect to different customer segments.
        After looking at the benefits of price discrimination (and the significant
        revenue and profit potential behind it), you will be able to figure out what
        type and how to implement price discrimination for your products and services.\n\n4
        - In this final module we will look at pricing psychology. You will then be
        able to \"manipulate\" customers so they perceive a higher value in the products
        and services that you deliver, or so that they feel less pain by paying the
        price of purchasing your products. You will have in your toolkit multiple
        ways to maximize your sales, revenues, and profitability. We will also conduct
        a couple of experiments with volunteer customers to see how price affects
        perceptions, and how you can profit from it.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"marketing"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/79/9bc96015dc11e6b00bbd15c77cf496/marketing-Pricing-Strategy.jpg","id":"Zx7vV31ZEeWKYwric11Hpw","slug":"pricing-strategy","specializations":[],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["61"],"name":"Pricing

        is, among human sciences, the discipline with the strongest importance for
        the rediscovery, but also for the preservation and protection of cultural
        heritage, as Humankind’s universal patrimony. You will be introduced to the
        way we ourselves reflect on and are engaged with the study of human past:
        from the practical and material recovery of ancient traces in the field to
        the study and interpretation. On the other hand, the discovery of human past
        implies the correct conservation and presentation for both experts and general
        public: the study and protection of the past we share every day prevent from
        any possible destruction, misuse, abuse and thus cancellation of human memory.\n“Recovering
        the Humankind''s Past and Saving the Universal Heritage” presents to a large
        public Archaeology as a historical discipline: through an inter-disciplinary
        perspective you will follow the evolution and change of archaeology to the
        moment when natural sciences contributed to make the historical reconstructions
        scientifically sound; the aid of informatics and of virtual reconstructions
        gives new fascination to the already strong suggestion of Archaeology, as
        the discipline of discovery par excellence. Within this frame, Ebla, which
        is the glory of the Sapienza school of Oriental archaeology, will have an
        exemplary meaning in the course development as a long lasting experience on
        the field and an excellent example of the scientific results of combined researches
        and disciplines.\n\nMoreover, the course will focus on actual, innovative
        instruments to preserve, monitor and give value to cultural heritage through
        a multidisciplinary approach, based on a deep archaeological and historical
        knowledge but also on ICT technologies. The wide adoption of ICT technologies
        in our daily life is also impacting in the way in which we interact with our
        cultural heritage in particular in terms of preservation and dissemination
        of cultural objects.\n\nIn this course you will  learn the basic techniques  to
        digitize cultural objects and obtain 3D digital copies of a physical objects
        such as statues, vases or archaeological sites.  We will also discuss how
        to structure the raw data in order to facilitate and make effective the access
        to digital contents. In particular, we will present the European Data Model,
        a framework for collecting, connecting and enriching data on cultural objects
        provided by a number of museum, archives, sites and libraries in Europe.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"music-and-art"}],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["74"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/37/58140776ad96610f665a55ba21a7ba/Matthiae_Ebla.jpg","name":"Recovering

        John F. Kennedy entered the presidential limousine at Love Field in Dallas,
        Texas on November 22, 1963, he began his ride into history. That journey continues
        even today and we call it the Kennedy legacy. \n\nThis course will explore
        the Presidency, assassination, and lasting legacy of President John F. Kennedy.
        Students will learn how JFK’s life, administration, and tragic death have
        influenced the general public, the media, and each of the nine U.S. presidents
        who followed.\n\nUnderstanding the Kennedy legacy and being able to identify
        elements of his legacy within the context of modern politics helps understand
        many of the vexing problems that developed over the last half century as well
        as many of the challenges that confront us today.    \n    \nNovember 22,
        1963 was so powerful a moment that in the fifty years since the assassination,
        every U.S. President that followed JFK has used Kennedy’s words and actions
        in an effort to craft their own political image. Why does Kennedy’s influence
        persist, and will it continue? What are the effects? \n\nWe’ll address these
        questions and more as we explore The Kennedy Half Century. \n\nFollow on Twitter:
